# Advanced Techniques

## Overview

This section covers advanced orchestration patterns, monitoring, error handling, and optimization strategies for multi-agent systems.

---

## ðŸ”§ Advanced Orchestration Patterns

### 1. Dynamic Agent Scaling
- Monitor agent workload and scale teams dynamically
- Register additional agents and rebalance as needed

### 2. Quality Gates and Checkpoints
- Create quality gate tasks for code review, security, and performance
- Use multi-agent checkpoints to ensure standards

### 3. Feedback Loop Integration
- Collect user feedback with specialized agents
- Implement improvement tasks based on feedback analysis

---

## ðŸ“Š Workflow Monitoring

- Use real-time dashboards to track project status, agent activity, bottlenecks, and estimated completion
- Monitor agent performance: utilization, task time, quality score

---

## ðŸš¨ Error Handling and Recovery

- Monitor agent health and reassign tasks on failure
- Handle circular dependencies with validation and resolution
- Implement robust error recovery and backup agent assignment

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Optimization Strategies

1. **Agent Specialization**: Assign tasks matching agent expertise
2. **Task Granularity**: Break large tasks into manageable subtasks
3. **Communication Efficiency**: Use shared context and clear protocols
4. **Resource Optimization**: Monitor and balance agent workload

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Best Practices Summary

1. Plan agent collaboration patterns in advance
2. Monitor continuously with dashboards and metrics
3. Handle failures gracefully with recovery mechanisms
4. Optimize orchestration parameters regularly
5. Document workflows and patterns
6. Test orchestration before production
7. Gather and analyze feedback
8. Scale agent teams based on real workload
