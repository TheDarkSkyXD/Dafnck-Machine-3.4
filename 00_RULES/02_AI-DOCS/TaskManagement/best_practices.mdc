# Best Practices: MCP Task Management

## Agent Assignment
- Always use the `@` prefix for agent assignees in tasks.
- Assign only one primary agent per task for clarity and predictable auto-switching.
- Register and assign agents using MCP tools, not by editing JSON.

## Task and Subtask IDs
- Use the full date-based format for all new tasks and subtasks.
- Let the system auto-generate IDs; do not create them manually.
- Always quote IDs in tool calls.

## YAML Configuration
- Keep agent YAML configs in `/cursor_agent/yaml-lib/[agent_name]/` up to date.
- Ensure each agent has a `job_desc.yaml` and at least one rules/context file.

## Tool Usage
- Always use MCP tools for all operations; never edit JSON files directly.
- Use `manage_project`, `manage_agent`, `manage_task`, and `manage_subtask` for all management tasks.
- Use `call_agent` to explicitly switch to a specific agent role when needed.

## Maintainability
- Document any custom fields or advanced patterns clearly.
- Keep the documentation in `/ .cursor/rules/02_AI-DOCS/TaskManagement/` up to date with real usage.
