# load_core Action Implementation Guide

**Document ID**: DOC-20250127-008  
**Created By**: System Architect Agent  
**Category**: Feature Implementation  
**Task ID**: 20250628009  
**Branch**: sophisticated-rule-orchestration-platform

## 🎯 **OVERVIEW**

The `load_core` action is a new feature for the `manage_rule()` MCP tool that automatically loads essential rules during chat session initialization. This ensures that critical system rules are always available when starting a new conversation.

### Key Benefits
- **Automatic Session Setup**: Essential rules loaded without manual intervention
- **Performance Optimization**: Priority-based loading of most critical rules first
- **Intelligent Fallback**: Graceful handling when rules are missing or corrupted
- **Comprehensive Feedback**: Detailed status and actionable recommendations

---

## 🚀 **USAGE**

### Basic Usage
```python
# Load core rules at session start
result = manage_rule(action="load_core")
```

### Response Structure
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "action": "load_core",
  "core_rules_loaded": 4,
  "additional_rules_loaded": 2,
  "failed_rules": 1,
  "total_size_bytes": 45230,
  "loaded_rules": [...],
  "additional_rules": [...],
  "failed_rules": [...],
  "session_ready": true,
  "recommendations": [...]
}
```

## 📋 **CORE RULE PRIORITY**

### Primary Core Rules (Loaded in Order)
1. **`dhafnck_mcp.mdc`** - Main MCP runtime system and compliance
2. **`dev_workflow.mdc`** - Development workflow and task management
3. **`cursor_rules.mdc`** - Cursor rule guidelines and best practices
4. **`taskmaster.mdc`** - Task management system documentation
5. **`mcp.mdc`** - MCP architecture and tool specifications

### Additional Core Directories
The system also searches for rules in these directories:
- **`core/`** - Core system rules
- **`essential/`** - Essential operational rules  
- **`session/`** - Session-specific configuration rules

---

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

### Core Loading Algorithm
```python
def load_core_rules():
    # 1. Load primary core rules in priority order
    for rule_file in core_rules:
        if rule_exists(rule_file):
            load_and_validate(rule_file)
    
    # 2. Scan additional core directories
    for core_dir in ["core", "essential", "session"]:
        if directory_exists(core_dir):
            load_directory_rules(core_dir)
    
    # 3. Generate recommendations based on results
    return generate_recommendations(loaded, failed)
```

### Error Handling Strategy
- **Missing Files**: Logged as "not_found" but doesn't block loading
- **Corrupted Files**: Logged as "error" with specific error message
- **Permission Issues**: Graceful fallback with actionable recommendations
- **Empty Directory**: Warning with setup guidance

---

## 📊 **RESPONSE DETAILS**

### Loaded Rules Metadata
Each successfully loaded rule includes:
```json
{
  "file": "dhafnck_mcp.mdc",
  "path": ".cursor/rules/dhafnck_mcp.mdc",
  "size": 12450,
  "status": "loaded",
  "content_preview": "# Enhanced DhafnckMCP Runtime System...",
  "directory": "core" // for additional rules only
}
```

### Failed Rules Information
Failed rules include diagnostic information:
```json
{
  "file": "missing_rule.mdc",
  "path": ".cursor/rules/missing_rule.mdc",
  "status": "not_found",
  "error": "File does not exist"
}
```

### Intelligent Recommendations
The system provides contextual recommendations:

#### Success Scenarios
- **Optimal Loading**: All core rules loaded successfully
- **Partial Loading**: Some rules loaded with suggestions for missing ones
- **Performance Tips**: Optimization suggestions for large rule sets

#### Warning Scenarios  
- **Critical Missing**: Essential rules like dhafnck_mcp.mdc not found
- **File Errors**: Permission or corruption issues detected
- **Minimal Context**: Very few rules loaded, limited functionality

#### Error Recovery
- **No Rules**: Complete failure with setup instructions
- **Permission Issues**: Specific guidance for file access problems
- **Corruption Detection**: Instructions for rule file recovery

## 🔄 **INTEGRATION WITH EXISTING SYSTEMS**

### Phase 2 Compliance Integration
- **Document Validation**: Loaded rules validated against Phase 2 standards
- **Timeout Protection**: Loading operations respect timeout limits
- **Security Controls**: File access follows existing permission frameworks
- **Context Management**: Integrates with session initialization sequence

### Session Initialization Workflow

    A[Start Chat Session] --> B[Initialize MCP Tools]
    B --> C[Execute load_core Action]
    C --> D[Load Priority Rules]
    D --> E[Scan Core Directories]
    E --> F[Generate Recommendations]
    F --> G[Session Ready]
```

---

## 🎯 **USE CASES**

### 1. Automatic Session Setup
```python
# Called automatically during session initialization
def initialize_session():
    core_result = manage_rule(action="load_core")
    if core_result["session_ready"]:
        return "Session initialized with core rules"
    else:
        return "Session started with limited functionality"
```

### 2. Rule System Health Check
```python
# Validate core rule availability
def check_rule_health():
    result = manage_rule(action="load_core")
    critical_missing = [r for r in result["recommendations"] 
                       if r["type"] == "critical"]
    return len(critical_missing) == 0
```

### 3. Development Environment Setup
```python
# Ensure development rules are available
def setup_dev_environment():
    result = manage_rule(action="load_core")
    dev_rules = [r for r in result["loaded_rules"] 
                if "dev_workflow" in r["file"]]
    return len(dev_rules) > 0
```

## 🚨 **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### Common Issues

#### "No core rules loaded"
**Cause**: Rules directory missing or empty  
**Solution**: Initialize .cursor/rules/ directory with essential rule files

#### "Critical rule missing"
**Cause**: Essential files like dhafnck_mcp.mdc not found  
**Solution**: Restore from backup or recreate essential rule files

#### "Permission denied"
**Cause**: File system permission issues  
**Solution**: Check and adjust file permissions for .cursor/rules/ directory

#### "Loading timeout"
**Cause**: Large rule files or slow file system  
**Solution**: Optimize rule file sizes or increase timeout limits

### Diagnostic Commands
```bash
# Check rule directory structure
ls -la .cursor/rules/

# Verify file permissions
ls -la .cursor/rules/*.mdc

# Test manual rule loading
manage_rule(action="list")
```

## 📈 **PERFORMANCE METRICS**

### Expected Performance
- **Loading Time**: <2 seconds for typical core rule set
- **Memory Usage**: ~50KB for standard 5 core rules
- **Error Recovery**: <500ms for missing file detection
- **Recommendation Generation**: <100ms for analysis

### Optimization Features
- **Content Preview**: Limited to 200 characters to reduce memory usage
- **Lazy Loading**: Additional directories only scanned if they exist
- **Error Caching**: Failed file checks cached to avoid repeated attempts
- **Size Tracking**: Monitor total memory footprint of loaded rules

---

## 🔄 **FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS**

### Planned Improvements
1. **Caching Layer**: Cache loaded rules for faster subsequent sessions
2. **Rule Dependencies**: Automatic dependency resolution between rules
3. **Custom Priorities**: User-configurable rule loading priorities
4. **Hot Reloading**: Automatic reload when rule files change
5. **Compression**: Compress large rule content for memory efficiency

### Integration Roadmap
- **Phase 1**: Basic load_core functionality (✅ Complete)
- **Phase 2**: Advanced caching and performance optimization
- **Phase 3**: Dependency management and custom priorities
- **Phase 4**: Real-time rule synchronization and hot reloading
