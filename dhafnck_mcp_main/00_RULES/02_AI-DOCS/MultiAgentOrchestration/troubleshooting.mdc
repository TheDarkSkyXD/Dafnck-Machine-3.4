# Troubleshooting & FAQ

## Overview

This guide provides systematic approaches to diagnosing and resolving common issues in multi-agent orchestration systems. Each issue includes symptoms, root cause analysis, and step-by-step solutions.

---

## ðŸš¨ Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Agents Not Responding to Task Assignments
- **Symptoms**: Tasks stuck in "todo", no agent activity, orchestration completes but no work
- **Diagnosis**: Check agent registration, status, and assignments
- **Solutions**:
  - Register missing agents
  - Update agent capabilities
  - Assign agents to correct workstreams

### 2. Task Dependencies Creating Circular Loops
- **Symptoms**: Tasks stuck in "blocked", circular dependency errors
- **Diagnosis**: Validate task structure, check for cycles
- **Solutions**:
  - Break circular dependencies
  - Restructure task hierarchy

### 3. Agent Overload and Bottlenecks
- **Symptoms**: Some agents overloaded, others idle, project delays
- **Diagnosis**: Analyze workload distribution, check dashboard
- **Solutions**:
  - Automatic rebalancing
  - Add additional agents
  - Increase agent capacity

### 4. Poor Task Completion Quality
- **Symptoms**: Tasks marked complete but fail requirements, high rework
- **Diagnosis**: Analyze completion patterns, quality metrics
- **Solutions**:
  - Implement quality gates
  - Add specialized review agents
  - Enhance agent capabilities

### 5. Communication Breakdowns Between Agents
- **Symptoms**: Conflicting solutions, duplicated effort, integration failures
- **Diagnosis**: Check shared context, analyze communication logs
- **Solutions**:
  - Implement shared context updates
  - Regular synchronization points
  - Define communication protocols

---

## ðŸ”§ Diagnostic Tools and Commands
- **System Health Check**: Validate project, agents, tasks, assignments, and integrity
- **Performance Analysis**: Monitor completion rate, utilization, bottlenecks, delays
- **Agent Capability Audit**: Identify capability gaps and unassignable tasks

---

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring and Prevention
- Set up proactive monitoring and automated remediation
- Regular health and performance checks
- Automated fixes for common issues

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Best Practices for Issue Prevention
1. Regular health checks and monitoring
2. Gradual scaling of agent teams
3. Maintain clear documentation
4. Implement quality gates
5. Establish communication protocols
6. Audit and update agent capabilities
7. Plan dependencies carefully
8. Continuously optimize performance

---

## ðŸ“š Quick Reference
- **Emergency Commands**: Rebalance, unassign, validate, dashboard
- **Common Fix Patterns**: Register/assign agents, update stuck tasks, create quality/sync tasks
