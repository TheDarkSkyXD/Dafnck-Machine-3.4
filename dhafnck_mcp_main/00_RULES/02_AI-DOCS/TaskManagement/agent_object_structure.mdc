# Agent Object Structure & Management

## Source of Truth
- Agent data is managed by MCP tools and stored in `/cursor_agent/.cursor/rules/brain/projects.json` (never edit directly).

## Agent Fields (Actual Implementation)
| Field         | Type        | Description                       |
|-------------- |------------ |-----------------------------------|
| id            | str         | Agent identifier                   |
| name          | str         | Agent name                         |
| call_agent    | str         | Agent call reference (e.g., @agent_name) |

## Agent Assignment
- Each agent can be assigned to one or more task trees within a project.
- Assignment is managed via the `agent_assignments` mapping in the project object.

## Example (from actual projects.json)
```json
"registered_agents": {
  "frontend_specialist": {
    "id": "frontend_specialist",
    "name": "Frontend Specialist Agent",
    "call_agent": "@frontend_specialist_agent"
  }
},
"agent_assignments": {
  "frontend_specialist": ["frontend"]
}
```

## MCP Tool: manage_agent
- The `manage_agent` tool provides a simple interface for agent management.
- **Parameters:**
  - `action: str` (register, assign, get, list, update, unassign, etc.)
  - `project_id: Optional[str]`
  - `agent_id: Optional[str]`
  - `name: Optional[str]`
  - `call_agent: Optional[str]`
  - `tree_id: Optional[str]`
- No direct support for advanced fields (capabilities, metrics, etc.) in the current tool interface.

## Advanced/Optional Fields
- Advanced agent properties (capabilities, metrics, etc.) are not present in the current implementation but may be added in the future. See [Advanced Patterns & Orchestration](mdc:.cursor/rules/02_AI-DOCS/TaskManagement/advanced_patterns.mdc).

## Integration & Relationships
- Agents are registered and assigned to projects and task trees via MCP tools.
- See [Project Object Structure](mdc:.cursor/rules/02_AI-DOCS/TaskManagement/project_object_structure.mdc) and [Task Object Structure](mdc:.cursor/rules/02_AI-DOCS/TaskManagement/task_object_structure.mdc).
