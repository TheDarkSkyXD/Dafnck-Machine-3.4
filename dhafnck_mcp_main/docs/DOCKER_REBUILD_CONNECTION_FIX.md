# Docker Rebuild Connection Fix for Cursor MCP Integration

## Problem Statement

When rebuilding Docker containers for the DhafnckMCP server, Cursor's MCP client connection becomes stale and requires a full Cursor restart to reconnect. This happens because:

1. **Docker Rebuild Creates New Container**: When you rebuild Docker, the MCP server gets a new container ID and potentially new network endpoints
2. **Cursor HTTP Connection Becomes Stale**: Cursor's MCP client maintains an HTTP connection to `http://localhost:8000/mcp/` that doesn't automatically detect server restarts
3. **No Automatic Reconnection**: The MCP client doesn't have built-in logic to handle server restarts gracefully
4. **Manual Restart Required**: Users had to close and reopen Cursor completely to reconnect

## Solution Overview

We've implemented a comprehensive **Connection Management System** that:

- **Monitors Connection Health**: Tracks active MCP client connections and their health status
- **Detects Server Restarts**: Automatically detects when the server has been restarted (e.g., after Docker rebuild)
- **Provides Reconnection Guidance**: Offers step-by-step instructions for quick reconnection without restarting Cursor
- **Enhanced Health Endpoints**: Provides detailed connection status via both MCP tools and HTTP endpoints

## Implementation Details

### 1. Connection Manager (`connection_manager.py`)

**Core Features:**
- **Connection Tracking**: Maintains registry of active MCP client connections
- **Health Monitoring**: Background task that monitors connection health every 30 seconds
- **Restart Detection**: Tracks server restart count and marks connections for validation
- **Stale Connection Cleanup**: Automatically removes inactive connections after 30 minutes
- **Connection Statistics**: Provides comprehensive metrics about active connections

**Key Components:**
```python
class ConnectionManager:
    - register_connection()     # Register new MCP client
    - update_connection_activity()  # Update last activity timestamp
    - handle_server_restart()   # Mark restart and invalidate connections
    - get_connection_stats()    # Get detailed connection statistics
    - cleanup_stale_connections()  # Remove inactive connections
```

### 2. Connection Health Tool (`connection_health_tool.py`)

**Purpose:** Provides detailed connection diagnostics and troubleshooting guidance via MCP tool.

**Features:**
- **Server Status Detection**: Identifies if server was restarted and needs reconnection
- **Connection Statistics**: Shows active connections, restart count, uptime
- **Troubleshooting Steps**: Provides specific guidance for different scenarios
- **Reconnection Instructions**: Step-by-step instructions for quick Cursor reconnection

**Usage via Cursor:**
```
Call the `connection_health_check` tool to get:
- Current connection status
- Server restart information  
- Step-by-step reconnection guidance
- Alternative troubleshooting methods
```

### 3. Enhanced Health Endpoints

**HTTP Health Endpoint:** `GET http://localhost:8000/health`
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": 1751280379.5246923,
  "server": "DhafnckMCP - Task Management & Agent Orchestration", 
  "version": "2.1.0",
  "auth_enabled": true,
  "connections": {
    "active_connections": 0,
    "server_restart_count": 1,
    "uptime_seconds": 45.2,
    "recommended_action": "reconnect"
  }
}
```

**MCP Health Tool:** Enhanced `health_check` tool includes connection information.

## Quick Reconnection Method (Recommended)

Instead of restarting Cursor completely, use this quick method:

### **ðŸ”„ Quick Cursor Reconnection Steps:**

1. **Open Cursor Settings** (Ctrl/Cmd + ,)
2. **Navigate to Extensions > MCP**
3. **Find the "dhafnck_mcp_http" server**
4. **Toggle it OFF** (disable the server)
5. **Wait 2-3 seconds**
6. **Toggle it back ON** (enable the server)
7. **Check if MCP tools are available again**

This method takes **5-10 seconds** vs **30-60 seconds** for a full Cursor restart.

## Troubleshooting Workflow

### 1. Check Connection Status
```bash
# Via HTTP endpoint
curl http://localhost:8000/health | jq .connections

# Via Cursor MCP tool
# Call the "connection_health_check" tool
```

### 2. Identify the Issue
- **`server_restart_count > 0`**: Server was restarted, use quick reconnection
- **`active_connections = 0`**: No active connections, likely need to reconnect
- **`recommended_action = "reconnect"`**: System recommends reconnection

### 3. Apply the Fix
- **Primary Method**: Use quick toggle method above
- **Fallback Method**: Restart Cursor completely
- **Debug Method**: Check Docker container status and logs

## Integration Points

### 1. MCP Entry Point Integration
```python
# In mcp_entry_point.py
from .connection_manager import get_connection_manager
from .connection_health_tool import register_connection_health_tool

# Register the connection health tool
register_connection_health_tool(server)

# Initialize connection manager on startup
connection_manager = await get_connection_manager()
await connection_manager.handle_server_restart()
```

### 2. Enhanced Health Endpoints
```python
# HTTP health endpoint includes connection info
health_data["connections"] = {
    "active_connections": stats["connections"]["active_connections"],
    "server_restart_count": stats["server_info"]["restart_count"],
    "uptime_seconds": stats["server_info"]["uptime_seconds"],
    "recommended_action": reconnection_info["recommended_action"]
}
```

### 3. Session Activity Tracking
The connection manager tracks activity for each MCP session and provides insights into connection health.

## Testing

### Automated Tests
```bash
# Run connection management tests
cd dhafnck_mcp_main
source .venv/bin/activate
PYTHONPATH=./src python tests/test_connection_management.py
```

**Test Coverage:**
- âœ… Connection registration and tracking
- âœ… Activity monitoring and updates  
- âœ… Stale connection cleanup
- âœ… Server restart detection and handling
- âœ… Connection statistics generation

### Manual Testing Workflow

1. **Start Docker Container**
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d
   ```

2. **Connect Cursor to MCP Server**
   - Enable the MCP server in Cursor settings
   - Verify tools are available

3. **Simulate Docker Rebuild**
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml down
   docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml build --no-cache  
   docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d
   ```

4. **Test Reconnection**
   - Try using MCP tools (should fail)
   - Use quick toggle method to reconnect
   - Verify tools work again

5. **Verify Health Status**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000/health | jq .connections
   ```
