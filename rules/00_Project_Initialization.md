- Steps:
    - Step ID: P01-T01-S00-01
      - Command: Scan and analyze the codebase structure and workflow files.
      - Tool: `file_search`, `list_dir`, `read_file`
      - Description: Systematically scan the codebase to:
          1. Map the full workflow as defined in `01_Machine/01_Workflow` (phases, steps, tasks, sequencing).
          2. Identify and summarize the roles of key state/configuration files (`DNA.json`, `Step.json`, etc.).
          3. List agents and their assigned responsibilities as per workflow and agent config files.
          4. Catalog required and optional documentation artefacts for each phase/step.
          5. Summarize the overall directory structure, highlighting rules, documentation, and agent configs.
      - Success Criteria:
          - `Scan Summary`: A written summary of the workflow, agent assignments, and key files is produced and logged.
          - `Findings`: Any ambiguities or missing links in the workflow are reported.
- Final Subtask Success Criteria: Codebase scan and summary are complete and documented before proceeding to environment setup.
