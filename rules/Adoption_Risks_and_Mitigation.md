## 1. Overview
Identify risks associated with adopting selected frameworks and libraries for DafnckMachine v3.1, and outline mitigation strategies.

**Example:**
- "Risk: Framework may lose community support. Mitigation: Monitor activity and have a migration plan."

## 2. Risk Assessment
- List potential risks for each selected framework/library.

**Example Table:**
| Framework | Risk                          | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Strategy                |
|-----------|-------------------------------|------------|--------|------------------------------------|
| React     | Breaking changes in updates   | Medium     | High   | Pin versions, test before upgrade  |
| Redux     | Declining community support   | Low        | Medium | Monitor, consider alternatives     |

## 3. Monitoring & Contingency
- Describe how risks will be monitored over time.
- Outline contingency plans for high-impact risks.

## 4. Success Criteria
