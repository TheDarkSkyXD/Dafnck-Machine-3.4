# Authentication and Authorization

## 1. Overview
Describe approaches for securing APIs and managing user access in DafnckMachine v3.1 backend.

**Example:**
- "JWT-based authentication is used for stateless API access, with role-based authorization for endpoints."

## 2. Authentication Methods
- Use JWT or OAuth2 for stateless authentication
- Store secrets securely (env vars, vaults)
- Enforce HTTPS for all endpoints

**Example Table:**
| Method   | Library/Tool | Usage Example                |
|----------|--------------|------------------------------|
| JWT      | jsonwebtoken | Sign and verify tokens       |
| OAuth2   | passport     | Third-party login            |

## 3. Authorization Strategies
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Attribute-based access control (ABAC) if needed
- Define permissions for each endpoint/resource

**Example Table:**
| Role    | Endpoint         | Permission   |
|---------|------------------|-------------|
| Admin   | /api/v1/users    | read, write |
| User    | /api/v1/profile  | read, write |
| Guest   | /api/v1/public   | read        |

## 4. Security Best Practices
- Rotate secrets regularly
- Log authentication/authorization events
- Rate limit login attempts

## 5. Success Criteria
- All endpoints are protected by authentication
- Authorization rules are enforced and auditable

## 6. Validation Checklist
