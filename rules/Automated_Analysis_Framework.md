# Automated Analysis Framework

## 1. Mission Statement
Specify the framework for automated market research, technical feasibility, and architecture generation in DafnckMachine v3.1.

**Example:**
- "Enable the system to autonomously analyze market trends, assess technical feasibility, and generate optimal architecture blueprints."

## 2. Automated Market Research
Describe the process and tools for automated market research.
- Data sources (APIs, web scraping, reports)
- Trend analysis
- Competitor benchmarking

**Example:**
- "System pulls data from public APIs and generates a competitor analysis matrix."

## 3. Technical Feasibility Analysis
Outline the steps for automated technical feasibility assessment.
- Technology compatibility checks
- Resource estimation
- Risk identification

**Example:**
- "System evaluates if the preferred stack meets performance and scalability requirements."

## 4. Architecture Generation
Describe how the system generates architecture blueprints.
- Component identification
- Data flow mapping
- Technology selection

**Example:**
- "System generates a high-level architecture diagram and recommends optimal components."

## 5. Optimization and Risk Assessment
Explain how the system optimizes technology choices and assesses risks.
- Technology scoring
- Automated risk matrix

**Example:**
- "System scores each technology option and flags high-risk areas for review."

## 6. Success Criteria
- Automated analysis covers market, technical, and architectural aspects
- Outputs are actionable and inform project planning
- Risks and optimizations are clearly identified

## 7. Validation Checklist
- [ ] Market research process is documented
- [ ] Technical feasibility steps are described
- [ ] Architecture generation is specified
- [ ] Optimization and risk assessment are included
