# Automated Development Pipeline Specifications

## 1. Mission Statement
Define a fully automated development pipeline, from requirements to deployment, leveraging agent swarms for coding, testing, and release.

**Example:**
- "Enable autonomous feature implementation, QA, and deployment with minimal human intervention."

## 2. Pipeline Stages
List and describe each stage of the automated pipeline.

**Example Table:**
| Stage                | Description                                 | Responsible Agent      |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| PRD Generation       | Generate requirements and feature breakdown | PRD Architect Agent   |
| Feature Implementation| Code features and integrate components      | Coding Agent          |
| QA Automation        | Run tests, quality gates, and security scans| QA Agent              |
| Deployment           | Release to production, monitor, rollback    | Deployment Agent      |

## 3. Automation Mechanisms
Describe the automation tools, triggers, and agent interactions at each stage.
- Automated code generation
- Continuous integration and testing
- Automated deployment and monitoring

**Example:**
- "On PRD approval, Coding Agent auto-generates code and triggers QA Agent for testing."

## 4. Quality Assurance Integration
Explain how QA is embedded in the pipeline.
- Automated test suites
- Quality gates before deployment
- Security and performance checks

**Example:**
- "No deployment occurs unless all tests and quality gates pass."

## 5. Monitoring and Rollback
Describe monitoring, alerting, and rollback mechanisms.
- Real-time monitoring dashboards
- Automated rollback on failure

**Example:**
- "If deployment fails, system auto-rolls back and notifies user."

## 6. Success Criteria
- Fully automated pipeline from requirements to deployment
- QA and monitoring integrated at every stage
- Rollback and alerting mechanisms in place

## 7. Validation Checklist
- [ ] All pipeline stages are documented
- [ ] Automation mechanisms are described
- [ ] QA integration is specified
- [ ] Monitoring and rollback are covered
