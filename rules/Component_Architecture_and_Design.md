# Component Architecture and Design

## 1. Overview
Describe guidelines for structuring frontend components, promoting reusability, and managing state in DafnckMachine v3.1.

**Example:**
- "All UI elements are built as reusable, composable React components."

## 2. Component Structure
- Use functional components with hooks
- Organize components by feature or domain
- Separate presentational and container components

**Example Table:**
| Component         | Type         | Purpose                        |
|------------------|--------------|--------------------------------|
| UserCard         | Presentational| Display user info              |
| UserList         | Container     | Fetch and render UserCards     |

## 3. Reusability Guidelines
- Design components to be stateless when possible
- Use props for configuration and data
- Document component API (props, events)

## 4. State Management
- Use local state for UI concerns
- Use global state (e.g., Redux, Context) for shared data
- Avoid prop drilling by using context or state libraries

## 5. Success Criteria
- Components are modular, reusable, and easy to test
- State is managed efficiently and transparently

## 6. Validation Checklist
- [ ] Component structure guidelines are described
- [ ] Example component table is included
- [ ] Reusability and state management practices are specified
- [ ] Success criteria are documented
