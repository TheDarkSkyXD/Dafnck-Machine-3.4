# Data Flow Specifications

## 1. Overview
Describe the key data flows within DafnckMachine v3.1, including how data moves between components and systems.

**Example:**
- "User authentication data flows from the frontend to the API Gateway, then to the Auth Service, and back."

## 2. Data Flow Diagrams
- Include or reference diagrams showing major data flows (e.g., sequence diagrams, flowcharts).
- Use tools like draw.io, Lucidchart, or embed a link to the diagram.

**Example:**
- ![Data Flow Diagram](link-to-diagram)

## 3. Process Descriptions
- Describe each major data flow step-by-step.
- Note data sources, transformations, and destinations.

**Example Table:**
| Flow Name         | Source     | Destination | Transformation/Notes           |
|------------------|------------|-------------|-------------------------------|
| User Login       | Frontend   | Auth Service| Hash password, issue JWT      |
| Data Retrieval   | Frontend   | Data API    | Filter, paginate, format JSON |

## 4. Validation & Error Handling
- Describe how data is validated at each step.
- Note error handling and fallback mechanisms.

## 5. Success Criteria
- All critical data flows are documented
- Diagrams and process steps are clear and actionable

## 6. Validation Checklist
