# Database Schema and Migrations

## 1. Overview
Describe the approach to database schema design, migration strategy, and versioning for DafnckMachine v3.1 backend.

**Example:**
- "The database uses a normalized relational schema, with migrations managed by Prisma."

## 2. Schema Design Principles
- Use normalization to reduce redundancy
- Define clear primary and foreign keys
- Use appropriate data types and constraints
- Document all tables and relationships

**Example Table:**
| Table    | Field         | Type      | Constraints         | Notes                |
|----------|--------------|-----------|---------------------|----------------------|
| users    | id           | UUID      | PK, unique, not null| User identifier      |
| users    | email        | VARCHAR   | unique, not null    | User email address   |
| posts    | user_id      | UUID      | FK: users.id        | Author relationship  |

## 3. Migration Strategy
- Use migration tools (e.g., Prisma, Flyway, Liquibase)
- Version migrations and track in VCS
- Test migrations in staging before production

## 4. Data Integrity & Versioning
- Enforce referential integrity with constraints
- Use seed scripts for initial data
- Maintain a changelog of schema updates

## 5. Success Criteria
- Schema is well-documented, normalized, and scalable
- Migrations are reliable and reversible

## 6. Validation Checklist
- [ ] Schema design principles are described
- [ ] Example schema table is included
- [ ] Migration and versioning practices are specified
- [ ] Success criteria are documented
