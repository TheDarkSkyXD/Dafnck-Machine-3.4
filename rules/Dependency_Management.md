# Dependency Management

## 1. Overview
Describe strategies for identifying and managing task dependencies in DafnckMachine v3.1.

**Example:**
- "Dependencies are tracked in the task management tool and visualized in a dependency graph."

## 2. Identifying Dependencies
- Review all tasks for prerequisites and blockers
- Document dependencies explicitly in task descriptions
- Use dependency mapping tools or diagrams

**Example Table:**
| Task                | Depends On         | Notes                  |
|---------------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| Create login UI     | Implement login API| UI needs API endpoint  |
| Write login tests   | Create login UI    | Tests require UI       |

## 3. Managing Dependencies
- Update dependencies as tasks evolve
- Flag and resolve circular or blocking dependencies
- Communicate dependency risks in standups

## 4. Visualization & Tools
- Use Gantt charts, dependency graphs, or Kanban links
- Integrate with task tracking tools for automation

## 5. Success Criteria
- All dependencies are documented and managed
- No critical blockers are overlooked

## 6. Validation Checklist
- [ ] Dependency identification process is described
- [ ] Example dependency table is included
- [ ] Management and visualization practices are specified
- [ ] Success criteria are documented
