**Example:**
- "After deployment, health checks and synthetic tests validate system readiness. Monitoring tools track uptime and errors."

## 2. Validation Steps
- List steps to validate a successful deployment (e.g., health checks, smoke tests, synthetic monitoring).

| Step         | Tool/Method      | Purpose                |
|--------------|------------------|------------------------|
| Health Check | Custom endpoint  | Verify service status  |
| Smoke Test   | Cypress/Postman  | Test critical paths    |
| Synthetic    | Pingdom/Uptime   | Simulate user traffic  |

## 3. Monitoring Tools
- List tools for monitoring and alerting (e.g., Datadog, Prometheus, Sentry).

| Tool       | Purpose             |
|------------|---------------------|
| Datadog    | Metrics, dashboards |
| Sentry     | Error tracking      |
| Prometheus | Metrics collection  |

## 4. Alerting Practices
- Define alert thresholds and escalation procedures
- Document notification channels (e.g., Slack, email)
