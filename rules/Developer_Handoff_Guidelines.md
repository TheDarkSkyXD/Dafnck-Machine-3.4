# Developer Handoff Guidelines

## 1. Overview
Define the process and best practices for handing off UI designs and assets to developers in DafnckMachine v3.1.

**Example:**
- "Designs are delivered via Figma with all components, tokens, and specs documented."

## 2. Handoff Process
- Use a shared design tool (e.g., Figma) for all UI assets
- Provide redlines, spacing, and sizing specs
- Include design tokens and style guides
- Link to documentation for each component

## 3. Asset Delivery
- Export all icons and images in SVG/PNG format
- Provide font files or links to web fonts
- Organize assets by component and usage

## 4. Documentation Requirements
- Annotate all screens with usage notes
- Document component states (default, hover, active, disabled)
- Include accessibility notes and keyboard navigation

## 5. Communication & Feedback
- Schedule a walkthrough session with developers
- Use a shared channel for questions and clarifications
- Track feedback and update documentation as needed

## 6. Success Criteria
- Developers can implement UI with minimal clarification
- All assets and specs are available and organized
- Handoff process is repeatable and efficient

## 7. Validation Checklist
- [ ] Handoff process is documented
- [ ] All assets are delivered and organized
- [ ] Component documentation is complete
- [ ] Accessibility and interaction states are included
