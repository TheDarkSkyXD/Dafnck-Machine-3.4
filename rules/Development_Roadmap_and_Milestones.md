# Development Roadmap and Milestones

## 1. Mission Statement
Outline the sequenced development roadmap and milestone planning for DafnckMachine v3.1, based on feature prioritization outputs.

**Example:**
- "Translate feature rankings into a clear, time-phased development plan with defined milestones."

## 2. Roadmap Structure
Describe the structure and phases of the development roadmap.
- MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
- Phase 1, Phase 2, etc.
- Release themes or groups

**Example Table:**
| Phase   | Features Included                | Target Date   | Milestone Description         |
|---------|----------------------------------|---------------|------------------------------|
| MVP     | User Authentication, Dashboard   | 2024-09-01    | Initial user access and core UI|
| Phase 1 | API Integration, Analytics       | 2024-10-15    | External connectivity, insights|

## 3. Milestone Planning
List key milestones, their criteria, and acceptance conditions.
- Feature completion
- QA and validation
- User/stakeholder review

**Example Table:**
| Milestone           | Criteria                          | Acceptance Condition         |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| MVP Complete        | All MVP features implemented      | QA passed, user sign-off    |
| Phase 1 Complete    | All Phase 1 features implemented  | QA passed, stakeholder review|

## 4. Sequencing Logic
Explain how features are sequenced based on priority, dependencies, and value/effort analysis.
- High-priority, low-dependency features first
- Grouping by release theme or technical dependency

**Example:**
- "Features with no dependencies and high value are scheduled for MVP. Dependent or high-effort features are planned for later phases."

## 5. Success Criteria
- Roadmap is clear, actionable, and time-phased
- Milestones are well-defined and measurable
- Sequencing logic is transparent and justified

## 6. Validation Checklist
- [ ] Roadmap structure and phases are documented
- [ ] Milestones and acceptance criteria are listed
