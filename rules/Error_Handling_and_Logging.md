# Error Handling and Logging

## 1. Overview
Describe error management, logging, and monitoring practices for DafnckMachine v3.1 backend.

**Example:**
- "All errors are logged with Winston, and alerts are sent for critical failures."

## 2. Error Handling Strategies
- Use try/catch blocks for async operations
- Return meaningful error messages and status codes
- Mask sensitive error details in production

**Example Table:**
| Error Type   | Handling Strategy         | Example Response                |
|-------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Validation  | 400 Bad Request           | { error: 'Invalid input' }      |
| Auth        | 401 Unauthorized         | { error: 'Not authenticated' }  |
| Server      | 500 Internal Server Error | { error: 'Unexpected error' }   |

## 3. Logging Practices
- Use structured logging (e.g., Winston, Bunyan)
- Log all errors, warnings, and key events
- Include request IDs and user context in logs

## 4. Monitoring & Alerting
- Integrate with monitoring tools (Datadog, Sentry)
- Set up alerts for critical errors and downtime
- Review logs and alerts regularly

## 5. Success Criteria
- All errors are handled gracefully and logged
- Critical issues trigger alerts and are resolved quickly

## 6. Validation Checklist
