# Feature Analysis Assessment

## 1. Mission Statement
Document the analysis and assessment of all candidate features for DafnckMachine v3.1, supporting objective prioritization.

**Example:**
- "Assess each feature for value, impact, complexity, and alignment with project goals."

## 2. Feature List and Descriptions
List all candidate features with brief descriptions.

**Example Table:**
| Feature Name         | Description                                 |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| User Authentication | Secure login and registration               |
| Dashboard           | Centralized user interface for management   |
| Analytics           | Real-time usage and performance tracking    |
| API Integration     | Connect to third-party services             |

## 3. Assessment Criteria
Define the criteria used for feature assessment (reference framework).
- Business value
- User impact
- Technical complexity
- Strategic alignment
- Dependencies

## 4. Feature Assessment Matrix
Provide a matrix scoring each feature against the criteria.

**Example Table:**
| Feature Name         | Business Value | User Impact | Complexity | Alignment | Dependencies |
|---------------------|---------------|-------------|------------|-----------|--------------|
| User Authentication | 5             | 5           | 3          | 5         | 2            |
| Dashboard           | 4             | 4           | 4          | 4         | 3            |
| Analytics           | 3             | 3           | 5          | 3         | 4            |
| API Integration     | 4             | 4           | 4          | 4         | 3            |

## 5. Key Findings and Insights
Summarize key findings from the assessment.
- High-value, low-complexity features
- Features with high dependencies or risks

**Example:**
- "User Authentication is critical and should be prioritized early. Analytics is complex and may require phased delivery."
