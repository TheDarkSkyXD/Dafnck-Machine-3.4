# Feature Scoring Ranking

## 1. Mission Statement
Apply the scoring methodology to rank features for DafnckMachine v3.1 using multi-criteria analysis and priority classification.

**Example:**
- "Rank features by aggregated scores and classify them into priority tiers for development planning."

## 2. Scoring Methodology Recap
Briefly recap the scoring system and criteria weights.
- Weighted scores per criterion
- Normalization and aggregation
- MoSCoW or tier classification

**Example Table:**
| Feature Name         | Total Score | MoSCoW Tier | Priority Group |
|---------------------|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| User Authentication | 23          | Must Have   | Core          |
| Dashboard           | 19          | Should Have | Phase 1       |
| Analytics           | 15          | Could Have  | Phase 2       |
| API Integration     | 18          | Should Have | Phase 1       |

## 3. Ranking Results
Present the ranked list of features with scores and classifications.
- List by descending score
- Indicate priority group or release phase

**Example:**
- "User Authentication and Dashboard are prioritized for the first release. Analytics is deferred to a later phase."

## 4. Priority Classification
Describe the classification system (e.g., MoSCoW, tiers, groups).
- Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, Won't Have
- Grouping by release or theme

## 5. Feature Grouping and Roadmap Implications
Explain how rankings inform the development roadmap.
- Group features by release phase
- Sequence based on dependencies and value

**Example:**
- "Core features are scheduled for MVP, while advanced analytics is planned for a future update."

## 6. Success Criteria
- All features are scored, ranked, and classified
- Priority groups are actionable for planning
- Roadmap implications are clear

## 7. Validation Checklist
- [ ] All features are scored and ranked
- [ ] Priority classification is documented
- [ ] Feature grouping is clear
- [ ] Roadmap implications are described
