# Integration Strategy

## 1. Overview

## 2. Integration Plan
- List each selected framework/library and its integration point in the architecture.
- Describe any required adapters, wrappers, or glue code.

**Example Table:**

|-----------|------------------|---------------------------------|
| React     | Frontend         | Use with TypeScript, ESLint      |
| Redux     | State Management | Integrate with React via hooks   |
| Axios     | API Layer        | Configure base URL, interceptors |

## 3. Testing & Validation
- Describe how integration will be tested (unit, integration, E2E tests).
- Note any required test harnesses or mock services.

## 4. Documentation & Training
- List documentation to be updated or created.
- Plan for developer onboarding or training sessions.

## 5. Success Criteria
- All integrations are documented and tested
- Developers are equipped to use new frameworks
