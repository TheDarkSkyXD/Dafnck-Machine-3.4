- **Time Period:** [e.g., Annually for 2024-2028]
- **Geographic Scope:** [e.g., Global, North America, Specific Countries]
- **Basis of Calculation:** [e.g., Based on total number of potential users multiplied by average annual spending per user in the category, or total units sold in the broader market segment.]
- **Data Sources:**
    - [e.g., Gartner reports on Cloud Services Market Size, Q3 2023]
    - [e.g., Statista data on E-commerce adoption rates, 2023]
    - [e.g., Industry association publications like [Association Name], Annual Report 2023]

### 3.2. Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM)

**Definition:** SAM is the segment of the TAM targeted by your products and services which is within your geographical reach. It's the portion of the market you can realistically serve with your current business model, sales channels, and product capabilities.

**Calculation/Estimate:**
- **Estimated SAM Value:** $[Specify Value, e.g., $Y Billion/Million]
- **Time Period:** [e.g., Annually for 2024-2028]
- **Basis of Calculation:** [e.g., TAM adjusted for factors such as specific industry verticals targeted, current distribution channels, product/service fit for specific sub-segments. For example, if TAM is global e-commerce, SAM might be e-commerce businesses in North America with revenues between $1M-$50M.]
- **Data Sources:**
    - [e.g., Market research firm [Firm Name] report on SME adoption of [Technology Type], 2023]
    - [e.g., Internal analysis of sales team reach and capabilities]

### 3.3. Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)

**Definition:** SOM (also known as Share of Market) is the portion of SAM that you can realistically capture in the short to medium term, considering competitive landscape, your marketing efforts, sales capabilities, and other operational factors.

**Calculation/Estimate:**
- **Estimated SOM Value:** $[Specify Value, e.g., $Z Million]
- **Target Market Share:** [e.g., X% of SAM within the first 3-5 years]
- **Time Period:** [e.g., Year 1, Year 2, Year 3 projections]
- **Basis of Calculation:** [e.g., Based on planned marketing spend, sales team size and conversion rates, early adopter targets, and competitive intensity. Often a top-down (percentage of SAM) and bottom-up (sales projections) approach is used and reconciled.]
- **Data Sources & Assumptions:**
    - [e.g., Historical market penetration rates for similar products/services]
    - [e.g., Sales pipeline projections and capacity]
