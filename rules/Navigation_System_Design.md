# Navigation System Design

## 1. Mission Statement
Design intuitive navigation systems for DafnckMachine v3.1 to support user wayfinding, content discovery, and efficient task completion.

**Example:**
- "Implement a persistent sidebar, top navigation, and mobile-optimized menus for seamless navigation across all devices."

## 2. Navigation Patterns
Describe the main navigation patterns used.
- Persistent sidebar
- Top navigation bar
- Breadcrumbs
- Tabbed navigation
- Hamburger menu for mobile

**Example Table:**
| Pattern         | Use Case                        |
|----------------|----------------------------------|
| Sidebar        | Main app navigation              |
| Top Nav Bar    | Global actions, notifications    |
| Breadcrumbs    | Deep navigation, wayfinding      |
| Tabs           | Switching between subviews       |
| Hamburger Menu | Mobile navigation                |

## 3. Menu Structures
List the menu items and their hierarchy.
- Main menu: Dashboard, Projects, Analytics, Settings
- Submenus: Under Projects (Active, Archived, Templates)

**Example:**
- "Settings is accessed via the user menu in the top nav bar."

## 4. Mobile Optimization
Explain how navigation adapts to mobile devices.
- Collapsible sidebar
- Hamburger menu
- Bottom navigation for key actions

**Example:**
- "On mobile, the sidebar collapses into a hamburger menu and key actions are accessible via a bottom nav bar."

## 5. Accessibility Considerations
Describe accessibility features in navigation.
- Keyboard navigation
- ARIA labels
- Focus indicators
