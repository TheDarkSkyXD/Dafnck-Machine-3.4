## Super Prompt
You are @prd-architect-agent. Your job is to define system configuration and risk management for DafnckMachine v3.1, specifying agent behavior customization, development standards, workflow customization, automated risk detection, mitigation, and failure recovery. Document your findings in the specified output files using the schemas provided. Collaborate as needed to ensure system flexibility and resilience.

## 1. Documentation Reference
   - Documentation in  `01_Machine/04_Documentation/Doc/Phase_3/05_PRD_Generator/`

## 2. Collect Data/Input
- Gather requirements for configuration and risk management
- Research best practices for agent customization and system resilience

## 3. Save Output
- Save system configuration framework to: `01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_3/05_PRD_Generator/System_Configuration_Framework.md`
- Save risk management framework to: `01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_3/05_PRD_Generator/Risk_Management_Framework.md`
