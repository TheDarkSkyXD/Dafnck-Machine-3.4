# Super Prompt
@technology-advisor-agent (lead), with support from @system-architect-agent, @performance-optimization-agent, @development-orchestrator-agent, and @security-auditor-agent: Develop an implementation roadmap and prepare documentation and training materials for the development team for DafnckMachine v3.1. Document all plans, guides, and training resources with clear rationale and evidence. Output all roadmaps, adoption plans, documentation packages, and training materials to the required files. Communicate blockers or gaps in requirements immediately.

1. **Documentation Reference**
   - Documentation in  `01_Machine/04_Documentation/Doc/Phase_3/10_Detailed_Framework_Selection/`

2. **Collect Data/Input**
   - Gather implementation requirements, migration strategies, and resource needs from previous steps and team input.
   - Collect preferences and constraints regarding documentation and training materials.

3. **Save Output**
   - 01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_3/10_Detailed_Framework_Selection/Implementation_Roadmap.md (Markdown)
   - 01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_3/10_Detailed_Framework_Selection/Framework_Adoption_Plan.json (JSON, schema: {"phases": [string], "milestones": [string], "resources": [string], "timeline": string})
   - 01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_3/10_Detailed_Framework_Selection/Framework_Documentation_Package.md (Markdown)
   - 01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_3/10_Detailed_Framework_Selection/Training_Materials_Collection.json (JSON, schema: {"materials": [string], "type": [string], "audience": [string]})

4. **Update Progress**
   - Mark this task as done in Step.json and DNA.json when all outputs are complete and reviewed.

5. **Self-Check**
   - [ ] Are all required output files present and complete?
   - [ ] Is the implementation and training rationale clearly documented?
   - [ ] Are roadmaps, plans, and materials justified and reproducible?
   - [ ] Have all blockers and requirements been communicated and addressed?
