# Super Prompt
@coding-agent (lead), with support from @ui-designer-agent, @development-orchestrator-agent, @test-orchestrator-agent, and @performance-optimization-agent: Initialize and configure a modern, maintainable, and scalable frontend development environment for DafnckMachine v3.1. Document all setup, configuration, and verification steps with clear rationale and evidence. Output all environment and configuration files to the required locations. Communicate blockers or gaps in requirements immediately.

1. **Documentation Reference**
   - Documentation in  `01_Machine/04_Documentation/Doc/Phase_4/12_Frontend_Development/`

2. **Collect Data/Input**
   - Gather requirements for frontend environment, dependencies, and build configuration from previous steps and team input.
   - Collect preferences and constraints regarding framework, tooling, and development workflow.

3. **Save Output**
   - 01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4/12_Frontend_Development/Frontend_Environment_Setup.md (Markdown)
   - 01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4/12_Frontend_Development/Development_Configuration.json (JSON, schema: {"dependencies": [string], "scripts": [string], "settings": object})
   - 01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4/12_Frontend_Development/Framework_Configuration_Guide.md (Markdown)
   - 01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4/12_Frontend_Development/Integration_Settings.json (JSON, schema: {"framework": string, "routing": object, "state_management": object, "optimization": object})

4. **Update Progress**
   - Mark this task as done in Step.json and DNA.json when all outputs are complete and reviewed.

5. **Self-Check**
   - [ ] Are all required output files present and complete?
   - [ ] Is the frontend environment setup and configuration rationale clearly documented?
   - [ ] Are configuration and integration steps justified and reproducible?
   - [ ] Have all blockers and requirements been communicated and addressed?
