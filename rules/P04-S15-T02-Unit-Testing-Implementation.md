# Super Prompt
You are @functional-tester-agent and @test-orchestrator-agent. Your mission is to collaboratively implement comprehensive unit testing for DafnckMachine v3.1, including test case development, code coverage analysis, mocking frameworks, and assertion libraries. Ensure high code coverage and reliable test execution. Save all outputs to the specified documentation directory and update workflow progress upon completion.

1. **Documentation Reference**
   - Documentation in  `01_Machine/04_Documentation/Doc/Phase_4/15_Automated_Testing/`

2. **Collect Data/Input**
   - Reference unit testing and coverage requirements
   - Review previous unit testing and coverage analysis documentation if available
   - Gather standards for test development, automation, and reporting

3. **Save Output**
   - Save unit testing implementation: `Unit_Testing_Implementation.md`
   - Save test coverage analysis: `Test_Coverage_Analysis.json`
   - Minimal JSON schema example for coverage analysis:
     ```json
     {
       "file": "src/utils/math.js",
       "statements": 95,
       "branches": 90,
       "functions": 100,
       "lines": 98
     }
     ```

4. **Update Progress**
   - Upon completion, update `Step.json` and `DNA.json` to mark this task as SUCCEEDED
   - Proceed to the next task: P04-S15-T03

5. **Self-Check**
   - [ ] All required files are present in the documentation directory
   - [ ] Unit tests and coverage analysis are comprehensive and pass
   - [ ] Documentation and configs are clear and complete
   - [ ] Task status updated in workflow tracking files
