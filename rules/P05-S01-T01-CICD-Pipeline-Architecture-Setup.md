# Mission Statement
Design and implement comprehensive CI/CD pipeline architecture with automated workflow stages, integration points, and deployment strategies for DafnckMachine v3.1.

# Description
This task covers the design and implementation of a robust CI/CD pipeline, including architecture, workflow automation, integration points, and deployment strategies. The goal is to ensure reliable, scalable, and efficient deployment processes.

# Super-Prompt
You are @devops-agent. Your mission is to architect and implement a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline for DafnckMachine v3.1, ensuring automation, reliability, and integration with testing and deployment workflows. Document all procedures and best practices.

# Subtasks (Detailed)
## Subtask 1: Pipeline Architecture Design
- **ID**: P05-T01-S01
- **Description**: Design comprehensive CI/CD architecture including pipeline stages, workflow automation, integration points, and deployment strategies.
- **Agent**: @devops-agent
- **Documentation Links**: [CI_CD_Architecture_Design.md](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_5/16_Deployment_Automation/CI_CD_Architecture_Design.md), [Pipeline_Configuration.json](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_5/16_Deployment_Automation/Pipeline_Configuration.json)
- **Steps**:
    1. Analyze current infrastructure and requirements for CI/CD pipeline design (Success: "Infrastructure analysis completed", analysis_report.md exists)
    2. Design pipeline stages including build, test, security scan, and deployment phases (Success: CI_CD_Architecture_Design.md exists, content matches pipeline stages)
    3. Create pipeline configuration templates and workflow definitions (Success: Pipeline_Configuration.json exists, content matches "stages" and "workflows")
- **Success Criteria**: All steps completed, documentation created.

## Subtask 2: Pipeline Configuration & Implementation
- **ID**: P05-T01-S02
- **Description**: Implement functional CI/CD pipelines with automated build, test integration, deployment stages, and artifact management.
- **Agent**: @devops-agent
- **Documentation Links**: [Pipeline_Implementation_Guide.md](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_5/16_Deployment_Automation/Pipeline_Implementation_Guide.md), [Automation_Configuration.json](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_5/16_Deployment_Automation/Automation_Configuration.json)
- **Steps**:
    1. Setup CI/CD pipeline infrastructure and base configuration (Success: "Pipeline infrastructure initialized")
    2. Configure build automation with dependency management and artifact creation (Success: build-config.yml exists, build-service running)
    3. Integrate automated testing stages with quality gates (Success: pipeline-tests pass)
    4. Configure deployment stages with environment-specific settings (Success: deployment-config.yml exists, content matches environments)
- **Success Criteria**: Functional CI/CD pipelines with automated build, test, and deployment stages.

# Rollback Procedures
