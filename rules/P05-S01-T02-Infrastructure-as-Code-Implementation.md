# Mission Statement
Develop and implement infrastructure as code with automated provisioning, environment configuration, and resource management for DafnckMachine v3.1.

# Description
This task covers the development of infrastructure as code (IaC) using tools like Terraform or CloudFormation, enabling automated provisioning, environment management, and resource scaling. The goal is to ensure scalable, reliable, and version-controlled infrastructure.

# Super-Prompt
You are @devops-agent. Your mission is to develop and implement comprehensive infrastructure as code for DafnckMachine v3.1, ensuring automated provisioning, environment management, and resource scaling. Document all procedures and best practices.

# Subtasks (Detailed)
## Subtask 1: Infrastructure Code Development
- **ID**: P05-T02-S01
- **Description**: Develop comprehensive infrastructure as code using Terraform/CloudFormation templates with resource provisioning and environment configuration.
- **Agent**: @devops-agent
- **Documentation Links**: [Infrastructure_Code_Implementation.md](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_5/16_Deployment_Automation/Infrastructure_Code_Implementation.md), [IaC_Templates.json](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_5/16_Deployment_Automation/IaC_Templates.json)
- **Steps**:
    1. Design infrastructure architecture and resource requirements (Success: infrastructure-design.md exists, content matches resources)
    2. Develop Terraform/CloudFormation templates for core infrastructure (Success: main.tf and template.yaml exist, content matches resource/provider/variable)
    3. Implement environment-specific configurations and variables (Success: variables.tf exists, content matches dev/staging/prod)
    4. Validate infrastructure code syntax and best practices (Success: "Validation successful")
- **Success Criteria**: Complete infrastructure as code is developed with automated provisioning and configuration.

## Subtask 2: Environment Management & Provisioning
- **ID**: P05-T02-S02
- **Description**: Implement automated environment management with multi-environment provisioning, configuration management, and resource scaling.
- **Agent**: @devops-agent
- **Documentation Links**: [Environment_Management_Guide.md](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_5/16_Deployment_Automation/Environment_Management_Guide.md), [Provisioning_Configuration.json](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_5/16_Deployment_Automation/Provisioning_Configuration.json)
- **Steps**:
    1. Setup automated environment provisioning workflows (Success: "Environment provisioning configured")
    2. Configure multi-environment management with proper isolation (Success: environment-config.yml exists, content matches isolation)
    3. Implement resource scaling and optimization policies (Success: scaling-policies.yml exists)
    4. Test environment provisioning and scaling functionality (Success: HTTP 200 OK)
- **Success Criteria**: Automated environment management is implemented with multi-environment support and scaling.

# Rollback Procedures
- Revert to previous infrastructure code version on failure
- Restore environment configuration from backup

# Integration Points
- Infrastructure code integrates with CI/CD, deployment, and monitoring workflows

# Quality Gates
- Infrastructure Reliability: Automated provisioning and scaling
- Environment Isolation: Proper separation of environments
- Performance Standards: Automated scaling validation

# Success Criteria
- Infrastructure as code with version control
- Automated provisioning and scaling
- Environment-specific configuration

# Risk Mitigation
- Automated rollback on provisioning failure
- Environment isolation to prevent cross-environment issues
