# Mission Statement
Implement zero-downtime deployment strategies including blue-green and canary deployments with automated traffic management for DafnckMachine v3.1.

# Description
This task covers the design and implementation of advanced deployment strategies such as blue-green and canary deployments, ensuring zero-downtime, automated traffic management, and robust rollback procedures.

# Super-Prompt
You are @devops-agent. Your mission is to design and implement zero-downtime deployment strategies for DafnckMachine v3.1, including blue-green and canary deployments, traffic management, and health monitoring. Document all procedures and best practices.

# Subtasks (Detailed)
## Subtask 1: Zero-Downtime Strategy Design
- **ID**: P05-T03-S01
- **Description**: Design zero-downtime deployment strategies including blue-green, canary, and rolling updates with traffic management and health checks.
- **Agent**: @devops-agent
- **Documentation Links**: [Deployment_Strategy_Design.md](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_5/16_Deployment_Automation/Deployment_Strategy_Design.md), [Traffic_Management_Plan.json](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_5/16_Deployment_Automation/Traffic_Management_Plan.json)
- **Steps**:
    1. Analyze application architecture for zero-downtime deployment requirements (Success: deployment_requirements.md exists)
    2. Design blue-green and canary deployment workflows (Success: Deployment_Strategy_Design.md exists, content matches blue-green/canary)
    3. Develop traffic management and health check configurations (Success: Traffic_Management_Plan.json exists, content matches healthChecks/trafficRules)
- **Success Criteria**: Comprehensive zero-downtime deployment strategies are designed with clear traffic management and health check plans.

## Subtask 2: Deployment Workflow Automation
- **ID**: P05-T03-S02
- **Description**: Implement automated deployment workflows with zero-downtime strategies, traffic management, and health check integration.
- **Agent**: @devops-agent
- **Documentation Links**: [Deployment_Workflow_Automation.md](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_5/16_Deployment_Automation/Deployment_Workflow_Automation.md), [Workflow_Configuration.json](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_5/16_Deployment_Automation/Workflow_Configuration.json)
- **Steps**:
    1. Configure blue-green deployment environment setup (Success: "Blue-green environment configured")
    2. Implement automated traffic shifting for canary releases (Success: canary-traffic-rules.yml exists, content matches traffic-percentage)
    3. Integrate health checks and automated rollback triggers (Success: health-checks-config.yml exists, content matches health-thresholds)
    4. Test deployment workflows with simulated failures and rollbacks (Success: "Deployment workflow tests passed")
- **Success Criteria**: Automated deployment workflows are implemented with functional zero-downtime strategies and rollback capabilities.

# Rollback Procedures
- Automated rollback on deployment failure
- Restore previous deployment state

# Integration Points
- Deployment strategies integrate with CI/CD, infrastructure, and monitoring workflows

# Quality Gates
- Zero-Downtime: No service interruption during deployment
- Rollback Success: Automated rollback on failure
- Health Monitoring: Continuous health checks

# Success Criteria
- Zero-downtime deployments
- Automated traffic management
- Robust rollback mechanisms

# Risk Mitigation
- Automated rollback on failure
- Health monitoring and alerting
