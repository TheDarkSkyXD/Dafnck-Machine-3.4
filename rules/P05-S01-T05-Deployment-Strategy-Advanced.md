# Mission Statement
Implement blue-green deployment and canary release strategies with zero-downtime and gradual rollout for production deployments in DafnckMachine v3.1.

# Description
This task covers the implementation of advanced deployment strategies, including blue-green deployments and canary releases, ensuring zero-downtime, gradual rollout, and robust rollback and monitoring procedures.

# Super-Prompt
You are @devops-agent. Your mission is to implement blue-green and canary deployment strategies for DafnckMachine v3.1, including zero-downtime switching, gradual rollout, A/B testing, and automated rollback. Document all procedures and best practices.

# MCP Tools Required

- file_search
- list_dir
- run_terminal_cmd
- mcp_taskmaster-ai_get_task
- mcp_taskmaster-ai_set_task_status

# Result We Want
- Blue-green deployment with zero-downtime switching and rollback
- Canary release with gradual traffic shifting, A/B testing, and performance monitoring
- Automated rollback mechanisms

# Add to Brain
- Deployment Strategies: Blue-green, canary, gradual rollout
- Rollback Procedures: Automated rollback, health monitoring
- Performance Monitoring: A/B testing, traffic shifting

# Subtasks (Detailed)
## Subtask 1: Blue-Green Deployment Setup
- **ID**: P05-T05-S01
- **Description**: Implement blue-green deployment with zero-downtime switching and rollback procedures.
- **Agent**: @devops-agent
- **Documentation Links**: [Blue_Green_Deployment_Implementation.md](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_5/16_Deployment_Automation/Blue_Green_Deployment_Implementation.md), [Rollback_Configuration.json](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_5/16_Deployment_Automation/Rollback_Configuration.json)
- **Steps**:
    1. Setup blue-green deployment infrastructure and base configuration (Success: "Blue-green deployment infrastructure initialized")
    2. Configure blue-green deployment with zero-downtime switching (Success: blue-green-deployment.yml exists, content matches deployment/blue-green/zero-downtime)
    3. Implement rollback procedures with health monitoring and failure detection (Success: rollback-procedures.yml exists, content matches rollback/health-monitoring)
    4. Test blue-green deployment and rollback functionality (Success: "Blue-green deployment tests passed")
- **Success Criteria**: Functional blue-green deployment with zero-downtime switching and rollback.

## Subtask 2: Canary Release Implementation
- **ID**: P05-T05-S02
- **Description**: Implement canary release with gradual traffic shifting, A/B testing, performance monitoring, and automated rollback.
- **Agent**: @devops-agent
- **Documentation Links**: [Canary_Release_Implementation.md](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_5/16_Deployment_Automation/Canary_Release_Implementation.md), [AB_Testing_Configuration.json](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_5/16_Deployment_Automation/AB_Testing_Configuration.json)
- **Steps**:
    1. Setup canary release infrastructure and base configuration (Success: "Canary release infrastructure initialized")
    2. Configure canary release with gradual traffic shifting (Success: canary-release.yml exists, content matches deployment/canary/gradual-rollout)
    3. Implement A/B testing with performance monitoring (Success: A_B-testing-config.yml exists, content matches A/B-testing/performance-monitoring)
    4. Integrate automated rollback with canary release (Success: automated-rollback.yml exists, content matches rollback/canary/automated)
    5. Test canary release and rollback functionality (Success: "Canary release tests passed")
- **Success Criteria**: Automated canary releases with gradual rollout and performance validation.

# Rollback Procedures
- Automated rollback on deployment failure
- Restore previous deployment state

# Integration Points
- Advanced deployment strategies integrate with CI/CD, infrastructure, and monitoring workflows

# Quality Gates
- Zero-Downtime: No service interruption during deployment
- Rollback Success: Automated rollback on failure
- Performance Monitoring: Continuous validation

# Success Criteria
- Blue-green and canary deployments
- Automated rollback and monitoring
- Gradual rollout and A/B testing

# Risk Mitigation
- Automated rollback on failure
- Health monitoring and alerting
