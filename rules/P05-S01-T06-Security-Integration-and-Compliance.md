# Subtasks (Detailed)
## Subtask 1: Security Scanning Integration
- **ID**: P05-T06-S01
- **Description**: Integrate automated security scanning tools into CI/CD pipelines for vulnerability detection and code analysis.
- **Agent**: @security-auditor-agent
- **Documentation Links**: [Security_Scanning_Integration.md](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_5/16_Deployment_Automation/Security_Scanning_Integration.md), [Vulnerability_Scan_Configuration.json](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_5/16_Deployment_Automation/Vulnerability_Scan_Configuration.json)
- **Steps**:
    1. Select and configure security scanning tools for CI/CD integration (Success: "Security scanning tools configured")
    2. Integrate vulnerability scanning in build and deployment stages (Success: vulnerability-scan-config.yml exists, content matches vulnerability-scan/build-stage/deploy-stage)
    3. Implement automated code analysis for security best practices (Success: code-analysis-rules.yml exists, content matches code-analysis/security-rules)
    4. Test security scanning integration and generate reports (Success: "Security scan reports generated", security_scan_report.md exists)
- **Success Criteria**: Automated security scanning is integrated into CI/CD pipelines with vulnerability detection and reporting.

## Subtask 2: Compliance Automation Setup
- **ID**: P05-T06-S02
- **Description**: Implement compliance automation with policy enforcement, audit logging, and automated compliance checks in deployment pipelines.
- **Agent**: @compliance-scope-agent
- **Documentation Links**: [Compliance_Automation_Implementation.md](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_5/16_Deployment_Automation/Compliance_Automation_Implementation.md), [Policy_Enforcement_Configuration.json](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_5/16_Deployment_Automation/Policy_Enforcement_Configuration.json)
- **Steps**:
    1. Define compliance policies and enforcement rules for deployment (Success: compliance-policies.md exists, content matches compliance-policies/enforcement-rules)
    2. Integrate automated compliance checks in CI/CD pipelines (Success: compliance-checks-config.yml exists, content matches compliance-checks/pipeline-stages)
    3. Implement audit logging and reporting for compliance verification (Success: "Audit logging and reporting configured", audit_log_report.md exists)
    4. Test compliance automation and generate compliance reports (Success: "Compliance automation tests passed", compliance_report.md exists)
- **Success Criteria**: Automated compliance checks, policy enforcement, and audit logging are implemented in deployment pipelines.

# Rollback Procedures
- Revert to previous security or compliance configuration on failure
- Restore audit logs and compliance reports from backup

# Integration Points
- Security and compliance integrate with CI/CD, deployment, and monitoring workflows

# Quality Gates
- Security Compliance: Complete security scanning and compliance validation
- Audit Logging: Comprehensive audit trails
- Policy Enforcement: Automated policy checks

# Success Criteria
- Security-integrated pipelines
- Automated compliance checks
- Audit logging and reporting

# Risk Mitigation
- Automated rollback on security or compliance failure
- Continuous monitoring and alerting
