# Subtasks (Detailed)
## Subtask 1: Production Monitoring Setup
- **ID**: P05-T07-S01
- **Description**: Setup production monitoring with metrics collection, performance monitoring, health checks, and dashboard creation.
- **Agent**: @health-monitor-agent
- **Documentation Links**: [Production_Monitoring_Implementation.md](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_5/16_Deployment_Automation/Production_Monitoring_Implementation.md), [Metrics_Dashboard_Configuration.json](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_5/16_Deployment_Automation/Metrics_Dashboard_Configuration.json)
- **Steps**:
    1. Setup production monitoring infrastructure and base configuration (Success: "Production monitoring infrastructure initialized")
    2. Configure metrics collection with performance monitoring (Success: metrics-collection.yml exists, content matches metrics/collection/performance)
    3. Implement health checks with automated alerts (Success: health-checks.yml exists, content matches health/checks/alerts)
    4. Create monitoring dashboards with performance metrics (Success: monitoring-dashboards.json exists, content matches dashboards/metrics/performance)
    5. Test production monitoring and alerting functionality (Success: "Production monitoring tests passed")
- **Success Criteria**: Comprehensive production monitoring with metrics, health checks, and dashboards.

## Subtask 2: Alerting System Configuration
- **ID**: P05-T07-S02
- **Description**: Implement alerting system with rule-based alerts, notification channels, incident management integration, and escalation policies.
- **Agent**: @health-monitor-agent
- **Documentation Links**: [Alerting_System_Implementation.md](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_5/16_Deployment_Automation/Alerting_System_Implementation.md), [Notification_Channels_Configuration.json](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_5/16_Deployment_Automation/Notification_Channels_Configuration.json)
- **Steps**:
    1. Setup alerting system infrastructure and base configuration (Success: "Alerting system infrastructure initialized")
    2. Configure rule-based alerts with notification channels (Success: alert-rules.yml exists, content matches alerts/rules/notifications)
    3. Integrate incident management with escalation policies (Success: incident-management.yml exists, content matches incident/management/escalation)
    4. Test alerting system and incident management integration (Success: "Alerting system tests passed")
- **Success Criteria**: Functional alerting system with rule-based alerts and incident management integration.

# Rollback Procedures
- Revert to previous monitoring or alerting configuration on failure
- Restore monitoring dashboards and alert rules from backup

# Integration Points
- Monitoring and alerting integrate with CI/CD, deployment, and infrastructure workflows

# Quality Gates
- Monitoring Coverage: Comprehensive metrics and health checks
- Alerting Reliability: Timely and accurate alerts
- Dashboard Accuracy: Real-time performance metrics

# Success Criteria
- Production monitoring and alerting systems
- Health checks and automated alerts
- Monitoring dashboards

# Risk Mitigation
- Automated rollback on monitoring or alerting failure
- Continuous monitoring and alerting
