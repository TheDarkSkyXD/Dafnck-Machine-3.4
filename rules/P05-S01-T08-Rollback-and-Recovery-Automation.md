# Subtasks (Detailed)
## Subtask 1: Automated Rollback Implementation
- **ID**: P05-T08-S01
- **Description**: Implement automated rollback with failure detection and automatic rollback triggers.
- **Agent**: @devops-agent
- **Documentation Links**: [Rollback_Automation_Guide.md](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_5/16_Deployment_Automation/Rollback_Automation_Guide.md), [Recovery_Procedures.json](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_5/16_Deployment_Automation/Recovery_Procedures.json)
- **Steps**:
    1. Setup rollback infrastructure and base configuration (Success: "Rollback infrastructure initialized")
    2. Configure rollback with failure detection (Success: rollback-detection.yml exists, content matches rollback/detection)
    3. Integrate automatic rollback triggers with rollback (Success: automatic-rollback-triggers.yml exists, content matches automatic/rollback/triggers)
    4. Configure version management with rollback (Success: version-management.yml exists, content matches version/management)
    5. Integrate data consistency with rollback (Success: data-consistency.yml exists, content matches data/consistency)
    6. Test rollback and recovery functionality (Success: "Rollback and recovery successful")
- **Success Criteria**: Automated rollback system with failure detection and recovery procedures.

## Subtask 2: Disaster Recovery & Backup
- **ID**: P05-T08-S02
- **Description**: Implement disaster recovery with backup automation, data replication, recovery procedures, and business continuity.
- **Agent**: @devops-agent
- **Documentation Links**: [Disaster_Recovery_Implementation.md](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_5/16_Deployment_Automation/Disaster_Recovery_Implementation.md), [Backup_Configuration.json](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_5/16_Deployment_Automation/Backup_Configuration.json)
- **Steps**:
    1. Setup disaster recovery infrastructure and base configuration (Success: "Disaster recovery infrastructure initialized")
    2. Configure backup automation with disaster recovery (Success: backup-automation.yml exists, content matches backup/automation)
    3. Integrate data replication with disaster recovery (Success: data-replication.yml exists, content matches data/replication)
    4. Configure recovery procedures with disaster recovery (Success: recovery-procedures.yml exists, content matches recovery/procedures)
    5. Integrate business continuity with disaster recovery (Success: business-continuity.yml exists, content matches business/continuity)
    6. Test disaster recovery and backup functionality (Success: "Disaster recovery and backup successful")
- **Success Criteria**: Comprehensive disaster recovery with automated backup and recovery procedures.

# Rollback Procedures
- Revert to previous rollback or recovery configuration on failure
- Restore backup and recovery procedures from backup

# Integration Points
- Rollback and recovery integrate with CI/CD, deployment, and monitoring workflows

# Quality Gates
- Rollback Reliability: Automated rollback and recovery
- Backup Coverage: Comprehensive backup and data replication
- Version Management: Accurate version and data consistency

# Success Criteria
- Automated rollback and disaster recovery
- Backup automation and data replication
- Version management and data consistency

# Risk Mitigation
- Automated rollback on failure
- Continuous monitoring and alerting
