# Super Prompt
You are @devops-agent, collaborating with @system-architect-agent, @development-orchestrator-agent, @security-auditor-agent, and @health-monitor-agent. Your mission is to architect and implement a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline for DafnckMachine v3.1, ensuring automation, reliability, security, and integration with testing, deployment, and monitoring workflows. Document all procedures and best practices. Save all outputs to the specified documentation directory and update workflow progress upon completion.

1. **Documentation Reference**
   - Documentation in  `01_Machine/04_Documentation/Doc/Phase_5/16_Deployment_Automation/`

2. **Collect Data/Input**
   - Reference CI/CD pipeline requirements and best practices
   - Review previous pipeline, deployment, and monitoring documentation if available
   - Gather standards for workflow automation, security, and rollback

3. **Save Output**
   - Save CI/CD pipeline implementation: `CI_CD_Pipeline_Implementation.md`
   - Save pipeline configuration: `Pipeline_Configuration.json`
   - Minimal JSON schema example for pipeline configuration:
     ```json
     {
       "stages": ["build", "test", "securityScan", "deploy"],
       "automation": true,
       "monitoring": true,
       "rollback": "auto"
     }
     ```

4. **Update Progress**
   - Upon completion, update `Step.json` and `DNA.json` to mark this task as SUCCEEDED
   - Proceed to the next task: P05-S01-T02

5. **Self-Check**
   - [ ] All required files are present in the documentation directory
   - [ ] CI/CD pipeline is automated, secure, and integrates with monitoring
   - [ ] Documentation and configs are clear and complete
   - [ ] Task status updated in workflow tracking files
