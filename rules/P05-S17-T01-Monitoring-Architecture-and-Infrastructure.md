# Super Prompt
You are @health-monitor-agent, collaborating with @devops-agent, @data-analyst-agent, @performance-optimizer-agent, and @business-intelligence-agent. Your mission is to design and implement a robust monitoring architecture and infrastructure for DafnckMachine v3.1, ensuring comprehensive observability, reliable data collection, and scalable monitoring capabilities. Document all architecture and setup procedures with clear guidelines and best practices. Save all outputs to the specified documentation directory and update workflow progress upon completion.

1. **Documentation Reference**
   - Documentation in  `01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_5/17_Monitoring_Analytics/`

2. **Collect Data/Input**
   - Reference monitoring architecture and observability requirements
   - Review previous monitoring, analytics, and infrastructure documentation if available
   - Gather standards for observability, metrics collection, and platform configuration

3. **Save Output**
   - Save monitoring architecture design: `Monitoring_Architecture_Design.md`
   - Save observability strategy: `Observability_Strategy.json`
   - Save monitoring infrastructure setup: `Monitoring_Infrastructure_Setup.md`
   - Save platform configuration: `Platform_Configuration.json`
   - Minimal JSON schema example for platform configuration:
     ```json
     {
       "platform": "Prometheus",
       "dataCollection": true,
       "storage": "scalable",
       "integrationPoints": ["APM", "userAnalytics"]
     }
     ```

4. **Update Progress**
   - Upon completion, update `Step.json` and `DNA.json` to mark this task as SUCCEEDED
   - Proceed to the next task: P05-S17-T02

5. **Self-Check**
   - [ ] All required files are present in the documentation directory
   - [ ] Monitoring architecture and infrastructure are comprehensive and scalable
   - [ ] Documentation and configs are clear and complete
   - [ ] Task status updated in workflow tracking files
