# Mission Statement
Establish systems for collecting and analyzing user and performance feedback to drive continuous improvement for DafnckMachine v3.1.

# Description
Establish comprehensive feedback collection and analysis systems, integrating user insights and performance data to inform optimization and enhancement cycles. This includes implementing frameworks for user feedback, performance analysis, and actionable improvement recommendations.

# Super-Prompt
You are @knowledge-evolution-agent. Your mission is to implement a robust feedback collection and analysis system, integrating user and performance feedback into the continuous improvement process. Ensure all feedback channels are active, data is actionable, and the system supports ongoing optimization and enhancement.

# Tasks (Summary)
- Establish user feedback collection framework
- Analyze system performance data

# Subtasks (Detailed)
## Subtask-01: User Feedback Collection Framework
- **ID**: P05-T01-S01
- **Description**: Implement a comprehensive framework for gathering user feedback through various channels.
- **Agent**: @user-feedback-collector-agent
- **Documentation**: [Feedback_Collection_System.md](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_5/18_Continuous_Improvement/Feedback_Collection_System.md)
- **Steps**:
    1. Implement user feedback collection: feedback forms, user surveys, in-app feedback, review analysis, sentiment tracking (Tool: edit_file)
        - Success: `config/feedback_collection_config.json` exists and contains `"sentimentTrackingEnabled": true`
    2. Setup collection mechanisms (Tool: run_terminal_cmd)
        - Success: `feedback_collection_service` running, output contains "Feedback collection service started successfully."
- **Final Subtask Success Criteria**: All feedback channels are active and configured, and the system is ready to collect user feedback.
- **Integration Points**: Collected user feedback will be used by P06-S18-T02-Optimization-Cycle-Management.md for improvement prioritization.
- **Next Subtask**: P05-T01-S02

## Subtask-02: Performance Feedback Analysis
- **ID**: P05-T01-S02
- **Description**: Analyze system performance data and user experience metrics to identify optimization opportunities.
- **Agent**: @performance-optimizer-agent
- **Documentation**: [Performance_Enhancement_Strategy.md](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_5/18_Continuous_Improvement/Performance_Enhancement_Strategy.md)
- **Steps**:
    1. Analyze performance feedback: system performance data, user experience metrics, bottleneck identification, optimization opportunities (Tool: edit_file)
        - Success: `scripts/performance_analysis_config.json` exists and contains `"reportGenerationFrequency": "daily"`
- **Final Subtask Success Criteria**: Performance feedback analysis is configured, and initial optimization recommendations are generated.
- **Integration Points**: Performance analysis guides system optimization efforts and informs enhancement priorities in P06-S18-T04-Performance-Enhancement-Optimization.md.
- **Next Subtask**: None

# Rollback Procedures
- Revert problematic feedback collection or analysis configurations
- Restore previous feedback system state if errors occur

# Integration Points
- Feeds improvement prioritization and optimization cycles in subsequent tasks

# Quality Gates
- Improvement Effectiveness: Measurable improvement in feedback collection and actionable insights
- Data Quality: Accurate and validated feedback data

# Success Criteria
- [ ] Feedback collection system is active and configured
- [ ] Performance feedback analysis is operational

# Risk Mitigation
- Notify and continue on feedback collection errors
- Escalate to human on repeated performance analysis failures
