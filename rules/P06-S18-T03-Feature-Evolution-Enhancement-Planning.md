# Subtasks (Detailed)
## Subtask-01: Feature Roadmap Optimization
- **ID**: P05-T03-S01
- **Description**: Optimize the feature roadmap including evolution planning, scheduling, and prioritization.
- **Agent**: @knowledge-evolution-agent
- **Documentation**: [Feature_Evolution_Planning.md](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_5/18_Continuous_Improvement/Feature_Evolution_Planning.md)
- **Steps**:
    1. Optimize feature roadmap: feature evolution planning, enhancement scheduling, roadmap prioritization, development planning (Tool: edit_file)
        - Success: `01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_5/18_Continuous_Improvement/feature_roadmap_v3.2.md` exists and contains `status: "Optimized"`
    2. Setup planning tools (Tool: run_terminal_cmd)
        - Success: `roadmap_planning_service` running, output contains "Roadmap planning tools configured."
- **Final Subtask Success Criteria**: The feature roadmap is optimized with clear evolution plans and enhancement schedules.
- **Integration Points**: Guides development priorities and aligns with overall strategic goals.
- **Next Subtask**: P05-T03-S02

## Subtask-02: Enhancement Development Process
- **ID**: P05-T03-S02
