# Subtasks (Detailed)
## Subtask-01: Improvement Analytics Platform
- **ID**: P05-T06-S01
- **Description**: Implement a platform for tracking improvement metrics, enhancement analysis, and ROI measurement.
- **Agent**: @analytics-setup-agent
- **Documentation**: [Data_Driven_Improvement_Platform.md](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_5/18_Continuous_Improvement/Data_Driven_Improvement_Platform.md)
- **Steps**:
    1. Implement improvement analytics: improvement tracking, optimization metrics, enhancement analysis, ROI measurement (Tool: edit_file)
        - Success: `config/analytics_platform_config.json` exists and contains `"roiTrackingEnabled": true`
    2. Setup analytics data ingestion (Tool: run_terminal_cmd)
        - Success: `analytics_ingestion_service` running, output contains "Analytics data ingestion started."
- **Final Subtask Success Criteria**: Improvement analytics platform is implemented, providing insights for optimization decisions.
- **Integration Points**: Provides data-driven insights to P05-T06-S02 for metrics-based optimization.
- **Next Subtask**: P05-T06-S02
