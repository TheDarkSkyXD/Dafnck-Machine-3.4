# Tasks (Summary)
- Set up experimentation platform
- Implement feature testing and validation

# Subtasks (Detailed)
## Subtask-01: Experimentation Platform Setup
- **ID**: P05-T07-S01
- **Description**: Set up an A/B testing framework, including experiment design, statistical analysis, and result interpretation.
- **Agent**: @analytics-setup-agent
- **Documentation**: [A_B_Testing_Framework.md](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_5/18_Continuous_Improvement/A_B_Testing_Framework.md)
- **Steps**:
    1. Setup experimentation platform: A/B testing framework, experiment design, statistical analysis, result interpretation (Tool: edit_file)
        - Success: `config/ab_testing_platform_config.json` exists and contains `"defaultSignificanceLevel": 0.05`
    2. Initialize A/B testing service (Tool: run_terminal_cmd)
        - Success: `ab_testing_service` running, output contains "A/B testing service initialized and integrated."
- **Final Subtask Success Criteria**: Experimentation platform is set up, enabling data-driven feature testing and optimization.
- **Integration Points**: Enables P05-T07-S02 to conduct feature testing and validation.
- **Next Subtask**: P05-T07-S02

## Subtask-02: Feature Testing & Validation
- **ID**: P05-T07-S02
- **Description**: Implement processes for feature validation, user testing, performance testing, and feedback collection.
- **Agent**: @user-feedback-collector-agent
- **Documentation**: [Feature_Testing_Validation.md](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_5/18_Continuous_Improvement/Feature_Testing_Validation.md)
- **Steps**:
    1. Implement feature testing: feature validation, user testing, performance testing, feedback collection (Tool: edit_file)
        - Success: `config/feature_testing_config.json` exists and contains `"minTestersPerFeature": 10`
- **Final Subtask Success Criteria**: Comprehensive feature testing and validation processes are in place, integrating user feedback.
- **Integration Points**: Ensures quality improvements and user satisfaction for new and existing features.
- **Next Subtask**: None

# Rollback Procedures
- Revert problematic experimentation or testing configurations
- Restore previous experimentation or validation state if errors occur

# Integration Points
- Enables data-driven feature testing and validation

# Quality Gates
- Experimentation Effectiveness: Validated and statistically significant results
- Feature Quality: Comprehensive testing and user feedback integration

# Success Criteria
- [ ] Experimentation platform is set up and operational
- [ ] Feature testing and validation processes are active and validated

# Risk Mitigation
- Escalate to human on repeated experimentation or validation failures
- Notify and continue on minor issues

# Output Artifacts
