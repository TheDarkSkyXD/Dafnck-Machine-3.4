- Reduce technical debt

# Subtasks (Detailed)
## Subtask-01: Code Quality Enhancement
- **ID**: P05-T08-S01
- **Description**: Implement code review processes, quality metrics, refactoring strategies, and best practices.
- **Agent**: @development-orchestrator-agent
- **Documentation**: [Quality_Improvement_Processes.md](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_5/18_Continuous_Improvement/Quality_Improvement_Processes.md)
- **Steps**:
    1. Enhance code quality: code review processes, quality metrics, refactoring strategies, best practices implementation (Tool: edit_file)
        - Success: `config/code_quality_config.json` exists and contains `"automatedLintersEnabled": true`
    2. Setup code quality monitoring (Tool: run_terminal_cmd)
        - Success: `code_quality_monitor_service` running, output contains "Code quality monitoring setup complete."
- **Final Subtask Success Criteria**: Code quality is enhanced through systematic improvement and best practices implementation.
- **Integration Points**: Ensures a maintainable, efficient, and high-quality codebase.
- **Next Subtask**: P05-T08-S02

## Subtask-02: Technical Debt Reduction
- **ID**: P05-T08-S02
- **Description**: Implement strategies for identifying, planning, and reducing technical debt.
- **Agent**: @performance-optimizer-agent
- **Documentation**: [Technical_Debt_Management.md](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_5/18_Continuous_Improvement/Technical_Debt_Management.md)
- **Steps**:
    1. Reduce technical debt: debt identification, reduction planning, refactoring strategies, maintenance optimization (Tool: edit_file)
        - Success: `config/tech_debt_management_config.json` exists and contains `"debtPrioritizationStrategy": "high-impact-first"`
- **Final Subtask Success Criteria**: Systematic technical debt reduction processes are in place, improving maintainability and performance.
- **Integration Points**: Improves long-term system health, maintainability, and performance.
- **Next Subtask**: None

# Rollback Procedures
- Revert problematic code quality or debt management configurations
- Restore previous codebase or process state if errors occur

# Integration Points
- Ensures a maintainable, efficient, and high-quality codebase

# Quality Gates
- Code Quality: Enhanced and monitored code quality
- Technical Debt: Systematic reduction and management

# Success Criteria
- [ ] Code quality is enhanced and monitored
- [ ] Technical debt reduction processes are operational

# Risk Mitigation
- Notify and continue on code quality issues
- Escalate to human on repeated technical debt failures
