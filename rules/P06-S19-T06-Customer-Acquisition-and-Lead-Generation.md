## Subtasks (Detailed)
### Subtask-01: Lead Generation Strategy
- **ID**: P06-S19-T06-S01
- **Description**: Develop lead magnets, capture mechanisms, and nurturing workflows.
- **Agent Assignment**: @marketing-strategy-orchestrator
- **Documentation Links**:
  - [Lead Generation Strategy](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_6/19_Marketing_Outreach/A/Lead_Generation_Strategy.md)
  - [Acquisition Framework](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_6/19_Marketing_Outreach/A/Acquisition_Framework.json)
- **Steps**:
    1. Design lead magnets (e.g., ebooks, webinars, free trials).
    2. Implement lead capture mechanisms (e.g., landing pages, forms).
    3. Define qualification criteria and nurturing workflows.
- **Success Criteria**:
    - Lead magnets created and available.
    - Capture mechanisms operational.
    - Qualification and nurturing processes documented.
- **Integration Points**: Lead generation feeds customer acquisition and conversion funnels.
- **Next Subtask**: P06-S19-T06-S02

### Subtask-02: Conversion Funnel Optimization
- **ID**: P06-S19-T06-S02
- **Description**: Map, track, and optimize conversion funnels for acquisition efficiency.
- **Agent Assignment**: @analytics-setup-agent
- **Documentation Links**:
  - [Conversion Funnel Optimization](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_6/19_Marketing_Outreach/A/Conversion_Funnel_Optimization.md)
  - [Funnel Analysis Framework](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_6/19_Marketing_Outreach/A/Funnel_Analysis_Framework.json)
- **Steps**:
    1. Map out existing conversion funnels and set up tracking.
    2. Analyze funnel performance and identify improvements.
    3. Plan and implement optimization tests (e.g., A/B tests).
- **Success Criteria**:
    - Funnels mapped and tracked.
    - Initial analysis completed.
    - Optimization testing underway.
- **Integration Points**: Conversion optimization maximizes acquisition efficiency.
- **Next Subtask**: P06-S19-T07-S01

## Rollback Procedures
1. Pause or revert underperforming acquisition campaigns.
2. Adjust or remove ineffective lead magnets or funnels.

## Integration Points
- Lead generation supports acquisition and sales.
- Funnel optimization improves conversion rates.

## Quality Gates
1. Lead Magnet Effectiveness: High conversion rates
2. Funnel Performance: Improved conversion metrics

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Lead magnets created
- [ ] Capture mechanisms operational
- [ ] Qualification/nurturing workflows defined
- [ ] Funnels mapped and optimized

## Risk Mitigation
- Low Conversion: Test and optimize funnels
- Poor Lead Quality: Refine qualification criteria

## Output Artifacts
- [Customer_Acquisition_Strategy](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_6/19_Marketing_Outreach/Customer_Acquisition_Strategy.md): Lead generation and conversion funnel optimization

## Next Action
Design lead magnets and map conversion funnels with @marketing-strategy-orchestrator

## Post-Completion Action
