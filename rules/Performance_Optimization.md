# Performance Optimization

## 1. Overview
Describe techniques for optimizing frontend performance in DafnckMachine v3.1.

**Example:**
- "Code splitting and lazy loading are used to reduce initial bundle size."

## 2. Optimization Techniques
- Code splitting and lazy loading
- Minification and tree shaking
- Image optimization (compression, responsive images)
- Memoization and virtualization for large lists

**Example Table:**
| Technique         | Tool/Method         | Example                        |
|------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------|
| Code Splitting   | React.lazy         | Lazy load feature modules      |
| Image Optimization| WebP, srcset      | Responsive images              |

## 3. Monitoring & Analysis
- Use Lighthouse, WebPageTest, or Chrome DevTools
- Track performance metrics (TTFB, FCP, LCP)
- Set performance budgets and monitor regressions

## 4. Success Criteria
- App loads quickly and remains responsive
- Performance metrics meet or exceed targets

## 5. Validation Checklist
- [ ] Optimization techniques are described
- [ ] Example optimization table is included
- [ ] Monitoring and analysis practices are specified
- [ ] Success criteria are documented
