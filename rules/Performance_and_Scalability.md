# Performance and Scalability

## 1. Overview
Describe techniques for optimizing backend performance and scaling DafnckMachine v3.1.

**Example:**
- "Caching and connection pooling are used to reduce database load. Services are horizontally scalable."

## 2. Optimization Techniques
- Use caching (Redis, Memcached) for frequent queries
- Optimize database indexes and queries
- Use connection pooling for DB access
- Profile and optimize slow endpoints

**Example Table:**
| Technique         | Tool/Method   | Example                        |
|------------------|--------------|--------------------------------|
| Caching          | Redis        | Cache user sessions            |
| Connection Pool  | pg-pool      | Pool DB connections            |

## 3. Scalability Strategies
- Design stateless services for horizontal scaling
- Use load balancers to distribute traffic
- Monitor and autoscale based on load

## 4. Monitoring & Analysis
- Use APM tools (New Relic, Datadog)
- Track latency, throughput, and error rates
- Set performance budgets and monitor regressions

## 5. Success Criteria
- Backend remains performant under expected and peak loads
- System scales horizontally as needed

## 6. Validation Checklist
- [ ] Optimization techniques are described
- [ ] Scalability strategies are specified
- [ ] Monitoring and analysis practices are included
- [ ] Success criteria are documented
