# Prioritization Framework Development

## 1. Mission Statement
Establish a comprehensive, objective framework for evaluating, ranking, and sequencing product features in DafnckMachine v3.1.

**Example:**
- "Guide development planning by scoring features on business value, user impact, technical complexity, and strategic alignment."

## 2. Evaluation Criteria
List and define the criteria used for feature evaluation.

**Example Table:**
| Criterion            | Description                              | Weight (%) |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------|------------|
| Business Value       | Impact on revenue, growth, or goals      | 30         |
| User Impact          | Effect on user experience and satisfaction| 25         |
| Technical Complexity | Effort, risk, and resource requirements  | 20         |
| Strategic Alignment  | Fit with long-term vision and strategy   | 15         |
| Dependencies        | Prerequisite features or tech            | 10         |

## 3. Scoring Methodology
Describe how features are scored and ranked.
- Weighted scoring system
- Normalization and aggregation
- MoSCoW or tier classification

**Example:**
- "Each feature is scored 1-5 per criterion, multiplied by weight, and summed for a total score."

## 4. Ranking and Sequencing
Explain how features are ranked and sequenced for development.
- Priority tiers (Must, Should, Could, Won't)
- Dependency analysis
- Roadmap sequencing

**Example:**
- "Features with highest scores and fewest dependencies are scheduled first."

## 5. Risk Assessment and Mitigation
Describe how risks are assessed and mitigated in prioritization.
- Identify high-risk features
- Plan mitigation strategies

**Example:**
- "Features with high complexity and low value are deferred or require additional research."

## 6. Success Criteria
- Framework is objective, transparent, and actionable
- All features are evaluated and ranked
- Roadmap sequencing is clear and justified

## 7. Validation Checklist
- [ ] Evaluation criteria are defined and weighted
- [ ] Scoring methodology is documented
- [ ] Ranking and sequencing process is described
- [ ] Risk assessment is included
- [ ] Framework is ready for use
