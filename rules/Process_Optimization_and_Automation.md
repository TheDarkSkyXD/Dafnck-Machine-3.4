# Process Optimization and Automation

## 1. Overview
Describe approaches for optimizing workflows and automating repetitive tasks in DafnckMachine v3.1.

**Example:**
- "CI/CD pipelines, code linting, and automated testing reduce manual effort and improve quality."

## 2. Optimization Strategies
- Identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies through metrics and feedback
- Streamline handoffs and approvals

| Area           | Optimization Approach      | Tool/Method         |
|----------------|---------------------------|---------------------|
| Code Quality   | Automated linting         | ESLint, Prettier    |
| Testing        | Automated test execution  | Jest, Cypress       |
| Deployments    | CI/CD automation          | GitHub Actions      |
| Documentation  | Auto-generation           | Doc generators      |

## 3. Automation Opportunities
- List repetitive tasks that can be automated (e.g., builds, deployments, reporting)
- Prioritize based on impact and effort

## 4. Continuous Review
- Regularly review processes for new optimization/automation opportunities
- Solicit team suggestions and feedback

## 5. Success Criteria
- Manual effort is reduced and quality is improved
- Automation is reliable and well-documented
