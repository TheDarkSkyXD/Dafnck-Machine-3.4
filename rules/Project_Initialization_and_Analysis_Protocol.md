# Project Initialization and Analysis Protocol

## 1. Mission Statement
Define a universal project specification framework and automated analysis protocol for initializing any software project in DafnckMachine v3.1.

**Example:**
- "Enable autonomous project setup, market research, technical feasibility, and architecture generation for any project type."

## 2. Universal Project Specification
List the required specification fields and their purpose.

**Example Table:**
| Field                  | Description                                 |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Platform Selection     | Target platforms (web, mobile, etc.)        |
| Technology Preferences | Preferred languages, frameworks, tools      |
| Performance Requirements| Latency, throughput, scalability targets   |
| Integration Needs      | APIs, third-party services, data sources    |
| Constraints            | Budget, timeline, compliance, tech limits   |

## 3. Automated Analysis Capabilities
Describe the automated analysis steps and tools.
- Market research
- Technical feasibility
- Architecture generation
- Technology optimization
- Risk assessment
- Resource estimation

**Example:**
- "System runs automated market research and generates a technical feasibility report before architecture planning."

## 4. Initialization Workflow
Map the workflow from project brief to analysis output.

**Example Flow:**
1. User submits project brief
2. System captures all specification fields
3. Automated analysis runs (market, technical, architecture)
4. Results are reviewed and used for planning

## 5. Success Criteria
- Universal project specification fields are defined
- Automated analysis covers all required areas
- Initialization protocol enables autonomous project setup

## 6. Validation Checklist
- [ ] All specification fields are documented
- [ ] Automated analysis steps are described
- [ ] Workflow is mapped and actionable
- [ ] Protocol supports any project type
