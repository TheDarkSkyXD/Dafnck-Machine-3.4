# Scalability and Performance Guidelines

## 1. Overview
Describe strategies and best practices for ensuring DafnckMachine v3.1 is scalable and performant.

**Example:**
- "The system uses horizontal scaling and caching to handle increased load."

## 2. Scalability Strategies
- Horizontal scaling of stateless services
- Database sharding and replication
- Use of load balancers

## 3. Performance Optimization
- Caching strategies (in-memory, CDN)
- Asynchronous processing for heavy tasks
- Query optimization and indexing

## 4. Monitoring & Alerting
- Real-time performance monitoring (APM tools)
- Automated alerts for latency, errors, and resource usage

## 5. Testing & Benchmarking
- Load testing and stress testing
- Performance benchmarks for key endpoints

## 6. Success Criteria
- System maintains performance under expected and peak loads
- Bottlenecks are identified and addressed proactively

## 7. Validation Checklist
- [ ] Scalability strategies are documented
- [ ] Performance optimization techniques are described
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting are specified
- [ ] Testing and benchmarking are addressed
