# Security Model and Protocols

## 1. Overview
Describe the security architecture and protocols for DafnckMachine v3.1, including key principles and threat mitigations.

**Example:**
- "The system uses JWT for authentication and enforces HTTPS for all communications."

## 2. Authentication & Authorization
- Describe authentication methods (e.g., OAuth2, JWT, SSO)
- Role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC)

## 3. Data Protection
- Encryption in transit (TLS/HTTPS)
- Encryption at rest (AES-256, managed keys)
- Secure storage of credentials and secrets

## 4. Threat Mitigation
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting and brute-force protection
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

## 5. Compliance
- List relevant compliance standards (e.g., GDPR, SOC2)
- Describe how compliance is maintained

## 6. Success Criteria
- All sensitive data is protected in transit and at rest
- Authentication and authorization are robust
- Threats are actively mitigated

## 7. Validation Checklist
- [ ] Authentication and authorization are documented
- [ ] Data protection measures are specified
- [ ] Threat mitigation strategies are described
- [ ] Compliance requirements are addressed
