# State Management Strategy

## 1. Overview
Describe the approach for managing application state in DafnckMachine v3.1 frontend.

**Example:**
- "Redux is used for global state, while local state is managed with React hooks."

## 2. State Types
- Local UI state (e.g., form inputs, modal visibility)
- Global application state (e.g., user session, theme)
- Server state (e.g., fetched data)

**Example Table:**
| State Type   | Tool/Method   | Example                        |
|-------------|--------------|--------------------------------|
| Local       | useState      | Modal open/close               |
| Global      | Redux         | Auth status, theme             |
| Server      | React Query   | Fetched user data              |

## 3. State Management Tools
- useState/useReducer for local state
- Redux or Context API for global state
- React Query or SWR for server state

## 4. Best Practices
- Keep state minimal and colocated
- Normalize complex state structures
- Use selectors and memoization for performance

## 5. Success Criteria
- State is predictable, testable, and easy to debug
- State management scales with application complexity

## 6. Validation Checklist
- [ ] State types and tools are described
- [ ] Example state table is included
- [ ] Best practices are documented
- [ ] Success criteria are specified
