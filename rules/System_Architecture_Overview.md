# System Architecture Overview

## 1. High-Level Architecture
Describe the overall system architecture for DafnckMachine v3.1, including major components and their interactions.

**Example:**
- "The system uses a microservices architecture with a central API gateway, separate authentication service, and a frontend client."

## 2. Architecture Diagram
- Include or reference a diagram showing all major components and their relationships.
- Use tools like Lucidchart, draw.io, or embed a link to the diagram.

**Example:**
- ![System Architecture Diagram](link-to-diagram)

## 3. Rationale & Design Decisions
- Explain why this architecture was chosen (e.g., scalability, maintainability, security).
- List any trade-offs or alternatives considered.

## 4. Technology Stack
- List core technologies for each layer (frontend, backend, database, infrastructure).

**Example Table:**
| Layer      | Technology         |
|------------|-------------------|
| Frontend   | React, TypeScript |
| Backend    | Node.js, Express  |
| Database   | PostgreSQL        |
| Infra      | AWS, Docker, K8s  |

## 5. Success Criteria
- Architecture supports all functional and non-functional requirements
- System is modular, scalable, and maintainable

## 6. Validation Checklist
- [ ] High-level architecture is described
- [ ] Diagram is included or referenced
- [ ] Rationale and design decisions are documented
- [ ] Technology stack is specified
