# System Configuration and Risk Management

## 1. Mission Statement
Define system configuration capabilities and comprehensive risk management for DafnckMachine v3.1, including agent behavior customization, failure recovery, and resilience mechanisms.

**Example:**
- "Allow users to customize agent behavior and ensure system resilience through automated risk detection and recovery."

## 2. Configuration System
List configurable parameters and their impact.

**Example Table:**
| Parameter              | Description                          |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Agent Behavior         | Custom rules for agent actions       |
| Development Standards  | Coding, testing, and review policies |
| Quality Thresholds     | Minimum quality gates for releases   |
| Technology Constraints | Allowed/disallowed tech stacks       |
| Workflow Customization | User-defined process modifications   |

## 3. Risk Management Framework
Describe risk management features.
- Automated risk detection
- Mitigation strategies
- Failure recovery protocols
- Rollback mechanisms
- Emergency procedures
- System resilience

**Example:**
- "System automatically detects failures, rolls back changes, and notifies users."

## 4. Recovery and Resilience
Explain how the system ensures reliability and recovers from failures.
- Redundancy
- Automated backups
- Self-healing mechanisms

**Example:**
- "Nightly backups and automated failover ensure minimal downtime."

## 5. Success Criteria
- Configuration system is flexible and user-friendly
- Risk management and recovery protocols are comprehensive
- System resilience is validated

## 6. Validation Checklist
- [ ] All configuration parameters are documented
- [ ] Risk management steps are described
- [ ] Recovery and resilience mechanisms are specified
- [ ] System reliability is ensured
