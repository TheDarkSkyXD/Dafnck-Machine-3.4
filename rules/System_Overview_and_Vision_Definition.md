# System Overview and Vision Definition

## 1. Mission Statement
Define the core mission for DafnckMachine v3.1: fully autonomous AI-driven software delivery with agent swarm coordination and minimal human intervention.

**Example:**
- "Enable users to transform ideas into production-ready software through natural language interaction with specialized AI agents."

## 2. Vision
Describe the long-term vision for the system, focusing on autonomy, transparency, and user empowerment.

**Example:**
- "A future where software delivery is orchestrated by intelligent agent swarms, requiring only high-level user intent and providing full lifecycle automation."

## 3. Agentic Architecture Overview
Outline the architecture for agent swarm coordination, including:
- Specialized agent roles (e.g., PRD architect, coding agent, QA agent)
- Communication protocols
- Decision-making and escalation points
- Minimal human intervention design

**Example Table:**
| Agent Role           | Responsibility                        | Escalation Point         |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| PRD Architect Agent | Requirements capture, PRD generation   | User validation required |
| Coding Agent        | Feature implementation, code generation| On ambiguous requirements|
| QA Agent            | Automated testing, quality gates       | On test failure          |

## 4. Universal Technology Stack Support
Summarize the system's ability to support any technology stack, referencing the Technology Stack Matrix.

**Example:**
- "Supports web, mobile, desktop, system, and data science projects with platform-specific agent specializations."

## 5. Automated Development Pipeline
Describe the automated pipeline from requirements to deployment, including:
- PRD generation
- Feature breakdown
- Coding and testing automation
- Deployment and monitoring

**Example Flow:**
1. User submits project brief
2. PRD Architect Agent generates requirements
3. Coding Agent implements features
4. QA Agent validates
5. Deployment Agent releases to production

## 6. Quality Assurance and User Control
Explain how the system maintains quality and allows user control at key points.
- Automated quality gates
- User validation checkpoints
- Transparent reporting

**Example:**
- "After each major milestone, the user receives a summary and can approve or request changes before proceeding."

## 7. Success Criteria
- Comprehensive, actionable system vision documented
- Agentic architecture and lifecycle automation clearly specified
- User control and transparency mechanisms defined

## 8. Validation Checklist
- [ ] Mission and vision are clear and actionable
- [ ] Agent roles and escalation points are defined
- [ ] Technology stack support is described
- [ ] Automated pipeline is mapped
- [ ] Quality and user control mechanisms are specified
