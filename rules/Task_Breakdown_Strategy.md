# Task Breakdown Strategy

## 1. Overview
Describe the approach and methodology for breaking down features and requirements into actionable development tasks for DafnckMachine v3.1.

**Example:**
- "Features are decomposed into user stories, which are further split into atomic, testable tasks."

## 2. Methodology
- Use user stories and acceptance criteria as the basis for task creation
- Break down large features into epics, stories, and tasks
- Ensure each task is atomic, testable, and independently deliverable
- Use INVEST criteria (Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable)

**Example Table:**
| Feature         | Epic                | Story                        | Task                        |
|----------------|---------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| User Auth      | Auth System         | As a user, I can log in      | Implement login API         |
|                |                     |                              | Create login UI             |
|                |                     |                              | Write login tests           |

## 3. Task Definition Guidelines
- Each task should have a clear objective and acceptance criteria
- Tasks should be estimated for effort and complexity
- Avoid dependencies within a single task

## 4. Review & Refinement
- Regularly review and refine tasks with the team
- Adjust breakdown as requirements evolve

## 5. Success Criteria
- All features are broken down into actionable, testable tasks
- Tasks are clear, estimable, and independently deliverable

## 6. Validation Checklist
- [ ] Methodology is described
- [ ] Example breakdown is included
- [ ] Task definition guidelines are specified
