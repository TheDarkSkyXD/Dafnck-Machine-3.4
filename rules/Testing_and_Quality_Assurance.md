# Testing and Quality Assurance (Backend)

## 1. Overview
Describe backend testing strategies, tools, and QA processes for DafnckMachine v3.1.

**Example:**
- "All services are tested with Jest and Supertest. Integration tests cover API endpoints."

## 2. Testing Types
- Unit tests for services and utilities
- Integration tests for API endpoints and DB
- End-to-end (E2E) tests for workflows

**Example Table:**
| Test Type   | Tool         | Example                        |
|------------|--------------|--------------------------------|
| Unit       | Jest         | AuthService, UserService       |
| Integration| Supertest    | /api/v1/users endpoint         |
| E2E        | Cypress      | User registration flow         |

## 3. QA Processes
- Code reviews and static analysis
- Automated test runs in CI/CD
- Manual exploratory testing for edge cases

## 4. Coverage and Metrics
- Aim for 80%+ unit test coverage
- Track failed tests and regressions
- Use coverage reports to guide improvements

## 5. Success Criteria
- All critical backend paths are tested
- QA processes catch defects before release

## 6. Validation Checklist
- [ ] Testing types and tools are described
- [ ] Example test table is included
- [ ] QA processes and coverage goals are specified
- [ ] Success criteria are documented
