# UI Design System

## 1. Mission Statement
Establish a robust, scalable, and consistent UI design system for DafnckMachine v3.1, including foundational principles, component library, and implementation guidelines.

**Example:**
- "Provide a unified set of UI components and design rules to ensure visual consistency and efficient development."

## 2. Design Principles
List the core principles guiding the UI design system.
- Consistency
- Clarity
- Accessibility
- Efficiency
- Scalability

**Example Table:**
| Principle    | Description                              |
|--------------|------------------------------------------|
| Consistency  | Uniform styles and behaviors across UI    |
| Clarity      | Clear visual hierarchy and affordances    |
| Accessibility| Inclusive and usable for all users        |
| Efficiency   | Fast, intuitive interactions              |
| Scalability  | Adaptable to new features and platforms   |

## 3. Component Library
Describe the main UI components and their usage.
- Buttons
- Forms
- Cards
- Modals
- Navigation elements
- Tables and lists

**Example:**
- "Use the primary button component for all main actions. Card components display grouped content."

## 4. Implementation Guidelines
Explain how to use and extend the design system.
- Component usage rules
- Theming and customization
- Contribution process for new components

**Example:**
- "All new UI elements must use existing design tokens and follow accessibility guidelines."

## 5. Quality and Maintenance
Describe how the design system is maintained and validated.
- Regular audits
- Documentation updates
- Versioning and changelogs

## 6. Success Criteria
- UI is visually consistent and accessible
- Component library covers all common use cases
- System is easy to extend and maintain

## 7. Validation Checklist
- [ ] Design principles are documented
- [ ] Component library is described
- [ ] Implementation guidelines are clear
- [ ] Quality and maintenance processes are specified
