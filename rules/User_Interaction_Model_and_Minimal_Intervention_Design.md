# User Interaction Model and Minimal Intervention Design

## 1. Mission Statement
Design a workflow that maximizes automation while maintaining user control through minimal, strategic interventions.

**Example:**
- "Users provide a 15-20 minute project brief, then only intervene at key validation points."

## 2. Required User Inputs
List all required user inputs and their timing in the workflow.

**Example Table:**
| Input Stage         | Description                        | Estimated Time |
|---------------------|------------------------------------|---------------|
| Project Brief       | Initial requirements and goals      | 15-20 min     |
| Validation Check 1  | Review PRD and feature breakdown    | 5 min         |
| Validation Check 2  | Approve deployment plan             | 5 min         |

## 3. Strategic Validation Points
Describe when and how users validate or approve system decisions.

**Example:**
- "After PRD generation, user reviews and approves before coding begins."

## 4. Transparency Mechanisms
Explain how the system keeps users informed and in control.
- Automated progress reports
- Real-time status dashboards
- Notification of key events

**Example:**
- "Users receive a summary after each milestone and can request detailed logs."

## 5. Minimal Intervention Workflow
Map the workflow from user input to project delivery, highlighting automation and user checkpoints.

**Example Flow:**
1. User submits project brief
2. System generates PRD
3. User validates PRD
4. System implements features
5. User validates deployment
6. System deploys to production

## 6. Success Criteria
- Minimal user input required for project delivery
- Strategic validation points ensure user control
- Transparency mechanisms keep users informed

## 7. Validation Checklist
- [ ] All required user inputs are documented
- [ ] Validation points are clearly defined
- [ ] Transparency mechanisms are specified
- [ ] Workflow maximizes automation
