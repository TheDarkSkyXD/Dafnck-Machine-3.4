## 4. Research Methodology

A mixed-method approach will be employed, combining qualitative in-depth interviews with quantitative surveys to gather comprehensive insights.

### 4.1. Qualitative Research: In-depth User Interviews

*   **Objective:** To gain deep, contextual understanding of user experiences, motivations, pain points, and current behaviors related to the problem.
*   **Format:** Semi-structured interviews, allowing for flexibility to explore emergent themes.
*   **Duration:** Approximately 45-60 minutes per interview.
*   **Mode:** Remote video conferencing (e.g., Zoom, Google Meet) to allow for screen sharing if necessary and broader geographical reach.
*   **Number of Participants:** Aim for 6-8 participants per defined target segment. This number should provide sufficient data to identify patterns while remaining manageable. (Total: 12-16 interviews for two segments).

    *   **Participant Criteria (General):**
        *   Must fit within one of the defined target user segments.
        *   Must have experienced the problem domain in the last [e.g., 3-6 months].
        *   Willing to share their experiences openly.
        *   Access to a stable internet connection and a device for video conferencing.
    *   **Specific Criteria per Segment:**

## 10. Potential Challenges & Mitigation Strategies

*   **Challenge: Difficulty in recruiting target participants.**
    *   **Mitigation:** Diversify recruitment channels, increase incentive if necessary (within budget), broaden participant criteria slightly if initial criteria are too restrictive (after consultation), extend recruitment timeline.
*   **Challenge: Low survey response rate.**
    *   **Mitigation:** Keep survey concise and engaging, promote through multiple channels, offer a small incentive for survey completion (e.g., entry into a prize draw), send reminders.
*   **Challenge: Participant bias (e.g., social desirability bias).**
    *   **Mitigation:** Use open-ended, non-leading questions; ensure anonymity for survey responses; build rapport and trust in interviews; emphasize there are no right or wrong answers.
*   **Challenge: Technical issues during remote interviews.**
    *   **Mitigation:** Test technology beforehand, have backup communication methods, provide clear instructions to participants.
*   **Challenge: Researcher bias in data interpretation.**
    *   **Mitigation:** Involve multiple team members in data analysis (if possible), use a structured coding framework for qualitative data, clearly separate observations from interpretations.
*   **Challenge: Scope creep or research questions becoming too broad.**
    *   **Mitigation:** Adhere closely to the defined research objectives, use the interview guide as a framework, and prioritize questions that directly address validation goals.
