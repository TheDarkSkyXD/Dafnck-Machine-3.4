# Value vs Effort Analysis

## 1. Mission Statement
Map features by value and implementation effort to inform prioritization and maximize ROI for DafnckMachine v3.1.

**Example:**
- "Visualize features on a value/effort matrix to identify quick wins and high-impact priorities."

## 2. Value vs Effort Matrix
Describe the axes and scoring system for value and effort.
- Value: Business impact, user benefit, strategic alignment
- Effort: Technical complexity, resource/time requirements

**Example Table:**
| Feature Name         | Value (1-5) | Effort (1-5) | Quadrant         |
|---------------------|-------------|--------------|------------------|
| User Authentication | 5           | 3            | High Value/Low Effort |
| Dashboard           | 4           | 4            | High Value/High Effort |
| Analytics           | 3           | 5            | Low Value/High Effort  |
| API Integration     | 4           | 2            | High Value/Low Effort  |

## 3. Quadrant Analysis
Explain the four quadrants and their implications.
- High Value/Low Effort: Quick wins, prioritize first
- High Value/High Effort: Strategic investments
- Low Value/Low Effort: Fillers, consider if resources allow
- Low Value/High Effort: Defer or avoid

**Example:**
- "User Authentication and API Integration are quick wins. Analytics is a high-effort, lower-value feature and may be deferred."

## 4. Prioritization Implications
Describe how the analysis informs the roadmap.
- Schedule quick wins early
- Plan high-effort features for later phases
- Defer or drop low-value, high-effort features

## 5. Success Criteria
- All features are mapped on the value/effort matrix
- Quadrant analysis is actionable
- Roadmap reflects value/effort priorities

## 6. Validation Checklist
- [ ] Value and effort scores are assigned to all features
- [ ] Matrix and quadrants are documented
- [ ] Prioritization implications are described
- [ ] Roadmap is updated accordingly
